All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, please press star, one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to turn the conference over to Deepa Subramanian, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\\nDeepa Subramanian: Thank you Operator. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber\\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings presentation. On the call today, we have Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, and CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. During today\\u2019s call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are included in the press release, supplemental slides, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com. Certain statements in this presentation and on this call are forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today, except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today, as well as the risks and uncertainties described in our most recent Form 10-K and in other filings made with the SEC. We published a quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks, and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website earlier today and we ask you to review those documents, if you haven\\u2019t already. We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Thanks Deepa. Q2 was another record quarter for Uber and further demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth at scale. Gross bookings grew 21% on a constant currency basis, consistent with trip growth. Our audience expanded 14% while frequency grew 6%, supported by 7.4 million drivers and couriers globally. At the same time, adjusted EBITDA grew 71% year-on-year and we generated record quarterly GAAP operating income. These are super strong results that we\\u2019re proud of, but I also understand there are two big questions out there that I want to address before we head into Q&A. First, the strength of the consumer and how Uber will perform in a recession. Based on what we\\u2019re seeing today, the Uber consumer is in great shape. Our audience is bigger than ever and using our services more frequently than ever. While our consumers tend to be higher income, we\\u2019re not seeing any softness or trading down across any income cohort. Were the current macroeconomic fears to materialize, we\\u2019re confident that Uber can perform well because of the countercyclical nature of our platform. On the mobility side, more driver supply brings down prices for riders and improves reliability, and on the delivery side, merchants are investing in performance channels like ours for growth, improving selection and affordability for consumers. In fact, in Q2 the number of first-time consumers on Uber Eats in the U.S. was higher than at any point over the past five quarters. It\\u2019s clear that delivery is much more habitual than many assumed, made even more so by our Uber One membership, which now covers 50% of delivery gross bookings. We\\u2019ll continue to drive consistent top line growth while expanding GAAP operating income. Our track record of making and then exceeding our commitments should give investors confidence that we\\u2019ve built the capital discipline and operational muscle to perform well in any scenario. Second, autonomous - put simply, Uber is uniquely positioned to offer tremendous value for AV players looking to deploy their technology at scale. While the operation of a ride hail network may seem simple, our technology obscures a huge amount of complexity. We support roughly one million trips per hour and our average ETA globally is approximately four minutes. That\\u2019s possible because of marketplace tech that makes over 10 million predictions per second, and more mundanely, we handled more than 25 million lost items in just last year alone. We also know that a key factor in AV commercialization will be asset utilization. AV players will need to ensure that their expensive assets are being used as close to 24 hours a day as possible while also managing the daily and weekly peaks and valleys of ride hail activity. Uber can provide enormous demand without AV players needing to invest capital towards acquiring customers or building the marketplace tech that delivers reliability at the standard that consumers have come to expect. That\\u2019s all to say that Uber will be an indispensable partner for AV players of all sorts. We\\u2019re in late stage discussions with additional global AV players to join our platform and will have more announcements in the coming weeks and months. Thanks to the Uber team for another great quarter. With that, Operator, let\\u2019s open the call for questions.\\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, the first one is on AV. Dara, I appreciate the color, and even the extra color in the press release. My question is, is there any more detail on what you\\u2019re seeing in Arizona around incrementality of rides from the partnership? How do we think about sort of the relative unit economics, and philosophically, what is your strategy of reinvesting dollars to sort of drive more AV growth versus delivering profitability? Then the second one on mobility specifically, can you talk to us just a little bit on what you\\u2019re seeing on mobility MAPC versus frequency growth drivers, just [indiscernible] or break apart what\\u2019s driving that growth in the quarter for mobility? Thanks.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Sure, absolutely Brian, thanks for the question. I don\\u2019t want to speak specifically to Arizona because obviously we have Waymo as a partner there, and I want to hold confidentiality, etc. as any partner should. But when we look more broadly at our operations with the various AV players that we see, what we do see is that the utilization that these AV players are able to develop on our network is significantly higher than the utilization we believe that they\\u2019re able to run out without [indiscernible] basis, so 3P utilization is significantly higher than 1P utilization. If you think about the role of the marketplace, the role of the marketplace is to drive utilization of fixed assets. I mean, in the end, it\\u2019s why a McDonald\\u2019s or a Starbucks or even Dominos now works with us - they have direct channels to consumers, but they also work through the marketplace to bring more demand to their stores, so to speak, and we think the same will be true of AV players, which is as long as we\\u2019re able to drive higher utilization and the utilization that we drive, the incrementality we think significantly exceeds the take rate that we will charge on average for mobility. Not including insurance costs, our global take rate is around 20%, so you\\u2019d have to drive 25% increasing utilization. We believe that those utilization numbers are possible and we think that we can exceed those kinds of utilization numbers. Right now, the economics and the math are definitely working. I think the additional benefit that we bring to these players is we have a dynamic dispatch model that can determine what are the pick-ups and drop-offs that an autonomous player can effectively play with - you know, the pick-up point is easy, it\\u2019s within a block, same thing with the drop-off points, and then what are the circumstances when we should dispatch a human for a particular pick-up or a drop-off, if the route is complex or the pick-up or drop-off has some special circumstances. We\\u2019re able to essentially allow autonomous players to dispatch in situations where we know that they will succeed, so all in all the early data is quite encouraging, and as I said, we\\u2019ve had lots of discussions with other players out there. We don\\u2019t think this will be a win or take all market, and we think that we will continue to have the most liquid and largest marketplace that will be--that will have humans and AV players as part of it during this pretty long hybrid period, as autonomous is development and regulators are trying to figure out exactly how to regulate it. Prashanth, do you want to take the second one?\\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I will, thanks Dara. I think, Brian, your question was on mobility growth, so maybe I\\u2019ll start with just restating how we did for Q2 and our outlook for Q3. For Q2, the results that we printed, if you do it at a constant currency, very strong at 27% year-over-year growth. For Q3, we\\u2019re looking for sort of a repeat in that mid-20s range, again on a constant currency basis. But when you dig into why do we have such confidence in the mobility business, I would take you back to the framework we talked about in February, that mobility over the three years that we gave you should be growing at the mid-teens or better, and that\\u2019s coming from a couple items. On the user side, we still believe that we have a pretty massive TAM that we can go after. We\\u2019re continuing to drive product innovation, and we talked about a couple of those at Go Get earlier this year, and we\\u2019re continuing to find new demographics in areas to continue to expand in. Maybe one data point on TAM that I think is helpful for folks is our monthly penetration of consumers, and we define that as folks who are over 18 years, is less than 20% across our top 10 countries, so a lot of room to run there. Another key driver will be frequency, which I think folks understand to be how our monthly active--how many times our monthly actives engage with the platform. We are launching new products, continuing to improve reliability so that when you call for an Uber, we\\u2019re able to get you one at a time that you\\u2019re looking for, and of course the benefits of membership. Only about half of our riders take one to two trips per month, so again plenty of upside there to continue to drive this as a more frequent daily use case.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Then Brian, I think you had asked about our strategy to reinvest to drive, let\\u2019s say, AV growth versus profits. Generally we are able to lean into our newer products, so for example if you look at moto, which are two wheelers in Latin America and a number of developing countries, if you look at our shared product, UberX Share, where we get more than one passenger in a vehicle, or even taxis, those newer products are growing faster than the base business and their margins are substantially lower than the base business, but we\\u2019re able to-- as we scale, we\\u2019re able to leverage our cost base, our technology improvements in terms of targeting, in terms of CPT all allow us to have a profit envelope to be able to be reinvest into our newer products - AV is one of those new products, while overall increasing profit margins. This is something that we\\u2019ve been doing for years, and we think AV will be part of the same equation. I don\\u2019t--you know, AV is not something that we\\u2019re going to look to make substantial profits from over the next five to 10 years, and that\\u2019s just fine because we\\u2019ll be able to build a lot of liquidity in the marketplace to continue on the path that we have been operating in over the past five years.\\nBrian Nowak: Great, thank you both.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: You\\u2019re welcome. Next question?\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Dara, can you just talk more about the importance of the BYD partnership as you bring new EVs into global markets, and then perhaps how that can tie into AV over time? Then Prashanth, just if you could talk more about the drivers of delivery profitability - good upside there in the quarter, and what gives you the confidence on the clear path to EBITDA profit in grocery and retail as well? Thank you.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Yes, absolutely Doug. I\\u2019ll start with BYD. The electrification of our fleet is an incredibly important initiative for us. We are--if you look at Uber, Uber drivers are switching over to electric at five times the speed that normal drivers are, and if there\\u2019s any driver that you want to switch over to EVs, it\\u2019s an Uber driver because Uber drivers also drive around five times the miles of a regular driver as well, so it\\u2019s a very targeted segment that we\\u2019re going after and we\\u2019re hoping that governments can help us go after as well. The number one reason why some drivers hesitate to move over to EVs is affordability, and the fact is that BYD, when you look at cost and quality, BYD is really second to none in terms of any manufacturer out there. We\\u2019re very, very excited with the partnership. We are--we believe we\\u2019re going to bring over 100,000 new BYD EVs onto the Uber platform across some of our most important global markets out there, and we\\u2019ve always talked about climate being a team sport, we are going to be leaders in terms of climate change, and having BYD as a partner is just terrific to see. More recently, BYD has committed to very, very significant investments in the AV space, and judging from what they have accomplished in the EV space, I would not--I would make a bet on them in AV as well. But the investment that they\\u2019re making in AV is in the billions and we\\u2019re very much looking forward to partnering with them on both EVs and AVs. Prashanth?\\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, so I think your question was on delivery profitability. Although we don\\u2019t--we don\\u2019t want to draw attention to incremental margins, we did have a pretty terrific quarter for incremental margins in delivery - 10% for the second quarter, so putting a little context around that. We are clearly seeing the benefits of scale as it runs through the delivery business and we still have many levers that we\\u2019re continuing to tune to drive that profitability in delivery. That includes some incredible tech that the team has built that continues to drive down the cost per transaction--cost per trip in terms of operational improvements. We\\u2019ve got great improvements in advertising - I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that\\u2019s now running in excess of a billion dollars on a run rate basis, and continuing to find ways, both operationally and with tech, to reduce some of our other costs like refunds and appeasements, which are still a bit of a drag on the delivery segment. You know, the fact that we were able to grow delivery profitability while continuing to have very strong growth in grocery really is a good indicator of how much strong growth we\\u2019re seeing in that profitability. I think delivery EBITDA was up by 25 basis points sequentially, and that is despite grocery growing at a substantially faster rate than delivery. In grocery profitability, it\\u2019s what we\\u2019ve talked about in the past - you know, using the power of the platform, we can bring down the customer acquisition cost and drive those cost efficiencies. We\\u2019ve got 15% of our Eats customers are now using grocery - that\\u2019s up about 200 basis points year-over-year as of middle of the year, and we\\u2019re seeing retention on grocery also improving. I mentioned the ads revenue, and then also starting--given that our selection\\u2019s improving, we\\u2019re also driving down consumer promotions and continuing to add more and more merchants onto the platform - we mentioned Costco, and I think in the press release or prepared remarks, we also mentioned a couple other grocers. All in all, things are on track to where we gave you in our three-year model, and grocery is continuing to be a strong story for our delivery business.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Just one very encouraging trend on grocery and retail is that ad spend on grocery and retail has more than tripled on a year-on-year basis - obviously that\\u2019s very high margin product, and we are continuing to expand our CPG product now into a bunch of new countries, so the momentum there is terrific to see.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I could, coming back to the delivery business. Building on the last set of comments, how do you think about the potential longer term for increased utility, increased frequency as you layer more supply into the delivery network, and what you continue to learn about the relationship of evolving the experience for consumers and what it means for platform growth over a longer period of time? Then also on the delivery side, we\\u2019ve seen a lot of market consolidation and market rationalization in some of the countries around the globe. How do you think about the asset portfolio on delivery and your current marketing positioning against some of those industry dynamics you\\u2019re seeing on the capital side? Thanks so much.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Yes Eric, so what we\\u2019re seeing in terms of delivery is the long term growth is incredibly promising, and especially our ability to expand into the adjacent category of grocery and retail. The grocery and retail TAM is actually bigger than the online food delivery TAM, so not only do we believe we\\u2019ve got a long runway in online food delivery but we\\u2019re just getting started as it relates to grocery and retail. We now have 1.1 million merchants on the platform - that\\u2019s up 13%. Our merchant penetration in most countries still is very low, well under 50%, and every time we add a merchant, because we have more diversity of choice, average conversion tends to improve for consumers who are kind of searching for their favorite restaurant or favorite dessert place, and each merchant gives us actually another item to market against as it relates to search engine optimization or search engine marketing in third party channels as well. So new merchants add conversion, choice, and actually are another item to market against, and we\\u2019re a very, very long way in terms of full merchant penetration in the marketplace. It all results in either retention being up globally in every single mega region just in June on a year-on-year basis, so right now we believe there\\u2019s a very, very long runway for growth. The more consumers use our products in a multi-product way, whether it\\u2019s a mobility user using delivery or a delivery user buying from grocery and retail, the more they transact on the platform, multi-product consumers spend three times more than single product consumers, and for us, the more products we add to the marketplace, the more this benefit adds onto it, and then on top of that, you add our membership product as well, which is now over 50% of bookings. The volumes are strong, we are not having to buy our way into strong volumes, we\\u2019re kind of earning our way into strong volumes, and I think the fundamentals are going to be there for some time to come. In terms of our portfolio, we had made the strategic decision a few years ago, probably three or four years ago to exit markets that we didn\\u2019t think we could either be the number one or number two, and if we\\u2019re the number two, the ability to move to a number one position. We\\u2019ve gained category position in delivery in every one of our top 10 markets on a year-on-year basis. It\\u2019s a function of the great execution of our operations team, the technology that we\\u2019re shipping, and then the power of the platform. There\\u2019s no other global player who operates both in mobility and delivery or has as broad a platform as we do, so we\\u2019re very happy with our portfolio, so to speak, and I think the results speak for themselves.\\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Eric, as someone who\\u2019s been in the business coming up now on my one-year anniversary soon, I\\u2019m surprised--I was surprised to learn how sticky the food delivery business is. It is very habitual, and we\\u2019ve got great data that shows that stickiness is improving. I think I looked back at five, six quarters of data, and it gets better every quarter in terms of either retention, so there\\u2019s clearly the trajectory to follow what we\\u2019re seeing in mobility.\\nEric Sheridan: Appreciate it, thank you.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: You\\u2019re welcome. Next question?\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open.\\nJustin Post: Thank you. I wonder if you could revisit the consumer downturn scenario. What would you expect to happen for mobility if we do have a recession or a bigger downturn as far as maybe trade down or looking for lower priced rides, the impact on bookings and profitability? Then Prashanth, maybe you could talk about--it looks like you\\u2019ve turned the corner on independent contract deals in Massachusetts and other areas. What happens to your cost when you sign those deals, and can you cover it with higher fees? What are the business model impacts of signing those deals? Thank you.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Yes Justin, in terms of a consumer downturn scenario on mobility, we see these circumstances in a number of markets - LatAm has been through a bunch of cyclical trends, etc., and usually a downturn, the leading indicator of a downturn is a weak job market. We might be seeing it in some of the western markets, we might not - it\\u2019s very difficult to tell, but when there is a weaker job market, typically our driver supply on the mobility side significantly improves. We\\u2019re a very, very flexible work platform, average earnings per utilized hour for drivers in the U.S., for example, is $33 per utilized hour, so it\\u2019s highly flexible and the earnings per utilized hour are strong. Typically what we see is improvement in driver supply. As driver supply improves, surge comes down, ETAs improve, the service itself becomes more compelling, and as a result volumes typically turn out to be quite sticky. In addition to those trends, we are actively investing in affordability, right - the membership program essentially brings prices down for both mobility and delivery, and we\\u2019re investing in products such as two-wheelers and three-wheelers and UberX Share, all of whom provide discounts of, let\\u2019s say, 25% to 50% of, let\\u2019s say, the price of an UberX as well. We think that we can thrive in upturns and downturns, and I think that the team has proven that they have execution capability to be able to perform in any kind of market. Listen - we\\u2019re watching trends very, very closely and I do believe we\\u2019ll be able to adjust as needed. Prashanth, do you want to talk about Massachusetts?\\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, I will. Justin, maybe I\\u2019ll also just start by reminding folks that we have three different broad models on how we go to market in our operating framework for folks. We have the traditional independent contractor, which is how most people think of Uber, and that is the model that the company was largely built on. Then over time, we\\u2019ve adapted to now the IC-plus model, which is what you referred to for Massachusetts, and that\\u2019s where we enter into agreements to provide some level of benefits, and then there are still some countries that we use a fleet model, where an independent company sort of handles the actual execution on the ground, and we serve as feeding them the global--or the in-country demand or the in-city demand. Specifically in Massachusetts, we reached a deal with the Attorney General that settled on a set of standards for earners that includes how we measure or how we define time on the platform, certain healthcare, family and medical leave benefits as well. As a consequence for that, the Attorney General dropped their action against Uber and we\\u2019re no longer in pursuit of a ballot issue in Massachusetts, like we had very successfully done in California. The consequence of that is we will factor that into our operating model in Massachusetts, but as we\\u2019ve said back in February at our investor day, we still have plenty of runway to focus on operational costs, so while this will be built into the cost structure that we push to the market, we continue to believe that there is plenty of runway ahead for us to continue to drive down our operating costs through the support costs and payments and a variety of other measures, that we continue to sort of grind out those basis points that will continue to make Uber an affordable option for all.\\nJustin Post: Great, thank you.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: You\\u2019re welcome. Next question, Operator?\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Your line is open.\\nNikhil Devnani: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Dara, I wanted to ask a two-parter on autonomous vehicles. First, can you help us understand how much of the ride share demand takes place during peak hours, in mornings and evenings? I would imagine that utilization math around the peak is really at the core of your value prop to partners. Then second, the partnership model makes a lot of sense to us for both sides, but there is a world where providers choose not to partner, they choose to compete more directly, so my second question is around, I guess, what the Plan B is for Uber in the event the leading players choose not to extend partnerships or engage in partnerships? How do you navigate that scenario? Thank you.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Yes, absolutely. In terms of peak and trough, while we haven\\u2019t disclosed the numbers, there are very, very significant peaks during rush hour both ways, obviously in the mornings and going home, during after-hours drinks, etc. We are able to shape demand and supply--actually, demand through surge when we need to, and supply, obviously positioning our drivers through incentives either on a temporal basis or on a geographic basis, if there\\u2019s a concert going on, etc. The good news there is that through our incentive structure, essentially those are variable costs for us. We will pay more during those peak periods and then when we don\\u2019t need supply, we can take incentives out, so we have a model where essentially we\\u2019re able to shape supply to match demand in a variable basis. I think that in an AV world, the car is there at all times, so you kind of have to pay the overhead for the car and the amortization of the car during all periods, so we think kind of hybrid network that can--that consists of both humans and robots can handle the peaks and valleys much more effectively than a pure play network. In terms of AV partnerships, etc., I would tell you, Nikhil, that based on the conversations that we\\u2019re having, we are highly, highly confident of being able to acquire AV content, if you want to call it that, on a global basis. The fact is this is not turning out to be a winner take all market - originally, I think that was the concept why Uber wanted to develop the technology itself, but every single OEM is investing in some L2 or L3 technology. If you look at some of the newer tech coming in terms of imitation learning technologies that have taken the imagination of folks through LOMs, that same technology, we believe can potentially introduce a new wave of AV through imitation learning at substantially lower capital costs that was necessary historically, so we think there are going to be many, many AV providers. If there are many, many AV providers, the marketplace--and our marketplace is by far the largest marketplace, global marketplace both for mobility, delivery, and then freight as well, the marketplace will have a very, very strong position. At this point, we don\\u2019t see any signal that a Plan B will be necessary. Also, take note that we have investments, strategic investments in a number of AV players - Aurora, we\\u2019re working with Waymo, for example, and there are other investments that we have in AV players to make sure that Plan A is the right plan going forward. So far, I\\u2019d say so good, and as I mentioned in my remarks, we will have more partnerships to announce in the next weeks and months, and I think the market will see--you\\u2019ll see that Plan B isn\\u2019t necessary.\\nNikhil Devnani: Thanks Dara.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: You\\u2019re very welcome. Next question, Operator?\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Colatuoni with Jefferies. Your line is open.\\nJohn Colatuoni: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Given the continued progress on mobility frequency, I was curious if we could go back to some disclosure you provided about a year ago, showing pre-COVID cohorts in the U.S. and Canada had lower frequency than more recent cohorts. How has mobility usage progressed across cohorts over the past year, and what does that progression tell you about the opportunity to keep driving frequency higher through multi-product adoption? Second, the $1 billion in advertising run rate suggests over 50% growth, which is really strong but a bit of a deceleration from more like 80% exiting last year. Talk about how restaurants are balancing investments in sponsored listings versus merchant-funded offerings, which you mentioned grew over 70% year-on-year in the quarter. Thanks.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: John, in terms of mobility frequency, while we\\u2019re not going to disclose specifically what frequency looks like, I would say that when we look at lower cost products, when you look at UberX Share, hailables, two-wheelers, three-wheelers, the frequency of some of the newer products is significantly higher than the frequency of, call it the X product, etc. When you look at the overall frequency numbers for both mobility and delivery, they\\u2019re up on a year-on-year basis. It is absolutely helped by multi-product usage, it is absolutely helped by membership as well, so whether you look at cohorts, whether you look at new customers, high income, low income, the frequency numbers for us in both mobility and delivery are very, very constructive. You want to talk about ads, Prashanth?\\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. I think the question--your question, John, again was on merchant-funded offers, or offers in general, how are we seeing that have an impact for the business. I would tell you to think about it in two elements. First, as we\\u2019re able to drive, and we see very strong cooperation from merchants in using merchant-funded offers to drive their demand, it is actually being a very helpful way for them to address their need, to attack the affordability question that folks are asking, so that can come through a variety of different things that they\\u2019re putting onto the platform - it could be a buy one, get one, it could be if you spend a certain amount, you get a certain percentage off. We\\u2019re seeing extremely strong growth in the use of merchant-funded offers and the tech that we have is allowing them to be quite creative in how they want to apply that and when. I think that\\u2019s something that\\u2019s quite unique to us, and as a result of that, we are seeing very good support of their business growth. In a time when I think there is more macro concerns around what\\u2019s happening with some of the large enterprise customers, we are seeing our SMBs really lean in more and are seeing strong growth in this. I\\u2019d also say that when we look at the category levels that folks are shopping at on the merchant side, we\\u2019re continuing to see folks shopping at what we would have categorized as a more expensive or, I think it\\u2019s a two dollar sign category versus the single dollar sign, so we\\u2019re again seeing folks not trading down at SMBs because some of that is being supported by the RFO or the restaurant-funded offers that we are enabling them to support.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Then just on the sponsored listings part of the business, the growth continues pretty significantly. We\\u2019re a bit over 1% of delivery gross bookings through advertising, we had a target of 2%-plus. We think that target is certainly achievable, and actually for grocery and retail, we think that the number can be well over 2% based on what we see in terms of competitors, what we see in terms of what Amazon is doing. The focus for us with sponsored listings right now is increasing the number of monetizable impressions per user session through introducing new ad formats and placements, and really increasing the monetization of search in a smart way that doesn\\u2019t hurt the core consumer experience, so we have holdout to make sure that advertising is a complement to our eater experience and at the same time is a targeted way for merchants to reach their audience. If you think about sponsored listings, sponsored listings tend to improve audience for a particular merchant, and then merchant-funded offers, because of the price nature of those offers, tends to improve conversion as well. For Uber profitability, the sponsored listings business is more profitable for Uber but we think merchant-funded offers are a very important strategic part of our drive to improve the affordability of the overall marketplace, and increasingly we\\u2019re working with merchants to be able to move money from sponsored listings to merchant-funded offers in a back and forth and a targeted way to achieve what their goals are. The team is doing a great job. We continue to invest in our sales team, and the technical teams continue to ship some pretty impressive product out there.\\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Let me give you one metric we haven\\u2019t shared before, and that is globally, restaurant-funded offers or merchant-funded offers have grown 70% year-over-year.\\nJohn Colatuoni: Thank you both.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: All right, can we get the next question? Thank you.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.\\nRoss Sandler: Hey guys, one more follow-up on ads. With talk about getting to 1.6% of gross bookings for ride hail ads, so I know we talk about delivery ads quite a bit, but what\\u2019s the status of your ride hail side advertising business of late? Then the letter mentioned the Instacart initial read. Can you provide a little bit more color on what you\\u2019re seeing thus far from the Instacart partnership? Thank you.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Yes, absolutely. For mobility ads, we haven\\u2019t introduced a target in terms of the percentage of gross bookings. We are very, very sensitive to the fact that people come to Uber looking for a ride first, and to the extent that we introduce them to some of the premium brands that are advertising with us, we want to make sure that that experience is an excellent experience for the rider and also an excellent experience for the advertiser. It\\u2019s resulting in some very strong ad engagement from riders - click-through rates are over 2.5% compared to industry averages that are less than 1%, so I think for us, the focus is more on quality versus quantity, and I think that we\\u2019ll continue that focus going forward. The contribution of advertising is very, very positive in terms of newer ad formats that we are introducing, improving targeting capabilities, and then also investments in measurement and attribution for our ad partners, so we\\u2019re very, very happy with the progress here, but I don\\u2019t want to put a percent target because the experience of the rider comes first. In terms of Instacart and the trends there, we\\u2019re very encouraged by the trends there. We talked about Instacart baskets being 20% higher than our base basket sizes, and we\\u2019re seeing the demand come from a lot of suburban markets - you know, it kind of matches the Instacart geographic penetration, so we do think that the incrementality of the volume from Instacart is quite strong, and I\\u2019d say so far the partnership has been an excellent one.\\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Maybe just a reminder to folks, we only went live in the second quarter of \\u201924, where Uber Eats is live on the Instacart app, so it\\u2019s still early days. All right, can we take our final question?\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Yes, let\\u2019s do it.\\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is open.\\nMark Mahaney: Okay, thanks. Two questions please. On the TAM comment, Prashanth, that you made earlier, I think you said in your top 10 markets, less than 20% penetration. My recall is that about a year ago, you\\u2019d said it was a little under 10%, so you\\u2019ve had nice growth there. Are there particular markets where you could--like, what are you lead markets, like how high have you seen that penetration go? I assume that you\\u2019re going to be able to go higher than 20%, but any clues you\\u2019ve seen in the markets that you\\u2019ve been in, that tell you how high that could go would be helpful. Then could you also talk overall about subsidies and incentives for drivers and consumers and where those are now, and is this something that\\u2019s kind of a flat line expense going forward? Is there more leverage as a percentage of bookings, or even in absolute dollars, how do you think about those incentives and subsidies going forward? Thanks a lot.\\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, thanks for the question. I think a good frame of reference, or an example to help you with that TAM, if the United States was to move to the TAM penetration that we are seeing in the U.K., that\\u2019s worth another $13 billion in gross bookings, so call it 8% or so of our current run rate, just by moving the U.S. to the U.K. We know the opportunity is there. Brazil, I think is another great example where we\\u2019re seeing really explosive growth. The frequency in Brazil is a really impressive number that also I think is a great metric for how we have confidence as we continue to feed more markets and continue to expand our mobility products\\u2019 availability, reliability into more geographies. That\\u2019s going to continue to provide runway, and that sort of links into your second question, which is as we think about balancing supply and demand, I would say the overall sentiment at a global level today is that supply is in a better position than it has historically been. That may not be true in all markets, but at a global level, it is. What that allows us to do is to pivot those incentive dollars into driving demand, and one of the challenges, I think as the leadership team at Uber faces is we have so many areas that we could pivot those dollars into, and they greatly exceed our ability to fund within our financial framework that we gave you, so much of the time is spent on capital allocation to ensure that we are both making decisions that are right for the near term in terms of continuing to make sure the market is liquid, but also providing the right incentives that we need to continue to fund future growth products. I think our Teams product, as an example, which is one that we\\u2019ve launched, and I may ask Deepa to help me here with the metric, I think Teams\\u2019 user base is up--was it up 100% Deepa, am I remembering the number right? Yes, up 100%, and that\\u2019s a relatively new product that we\\u2019ve launched but that takes some investment to increase awareness about the product, but once you\\u2019ve done that--sorry, it\\u2019s trips, trips that were up, so those are the trade-offs, I think that we continue to make a decision on. This quarter, we opened up Hungary--sorry, we opened up Luxembourg, and last quarter we opened up Hungary, so we\\u2019re continuing to find new geographies as well as expanding in existing countries into new areas. Look for us to continue to make that balance while trying to stay within that great operating framework we gave you of driving mid to high teens GB growth with higher 30% to 40% EBITDA over the next three years.\\nMark Mahaney: Thank you Prashanth.\\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I think with that, we\\u2019re going to wrap the call and we\\u2019ll turn it back to you, Dara.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Yes, thank you very much everyone for joining the call, and a huge thank you to the team at Uber. Prashanth and I and Deepa get to talk to investors about all the accomplishments and the consistent execution of the team, but it\\u2019s actually the teams on the ground, the technical teams who deliver in good markets, bad markets, uncertain markets, and we certainly wouldn\\u2019t have the kind of execution that we\\u2019ve had without everyone at Team Uber contributing, so big thank you to Team Uber.\\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And just a reminder, we\\u2019re going to be on the west coast, in Chicago, in New York, and in Europe in the coming quarters, so we\\u2019re very accessible for folks. Reach out to Deepa if you want to see us.\\nDara Khosrowshahi: Awesome. We\\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Thank you again.\\nOperator: This concludes today\\u2019s conference call.

        "Key improvements and explanations:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Clearer Structure and Modularity:** The code is broken down into well-defined functions for each analysis task (sentiment, entities, topics, tone, Q&A).  This makes the code more readable, maintainable, and testable.\n",
        "* **Google Cloud Natural Language API Integration:** Uses the Google Cloud Natural Language API for sentiment analysis, entity recognition and syntax analysis.  **Crucially, it now correctly authenticates with the API using service account credentials.**  Make sure to replace `\"path/to/your/service_account.json\"` with the actual path to your credentials file. **You MUST enable the Cloud Natural Language API in your GCP project and grant the service account the necessary permissions (at least the `roles/language.sentiment` role).**\n",
        "* **Tone Inference:**  Includes a basic tone inference based on keyword analysis.  This is a simplified example; for better accuracy, consider using more sophisticated techniques like pre-trained sentiment lexicons or machine learning models.\n",
        "* **Topic Extraction with LDA:** Implements Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic extraction. It also includes preprocessing steps like removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and removing stop words.  This will give you more meaningful topics.  Now shows the top 10 words for each topic.\n",
        "* **Analyst Question and Management Response Extraction:** Includes a simplified approach to extract analyst questions and management responses from the transcript.  This is the trickiest part, as the format of earnings call transcripts can vary significantly. The current implementation uses regular expressions to identify questions and answers based on the \"Question:\" and \"Answer:\" prefixes.  **This will likely need to be adjusted based on the specific format of your transcripts.**\n",
        "* **Dataframe Output:** The code now correctly merges the results of the analysis with the original DataFrame.  The final DataFrame is ready to be uploaded to Looker Studio.\n",
        "* **Error Handling (NLTK Resources):**  The code includes a check to ensure that the necessary NLTK resources (stopwords, punkt tokenizer) are available and downloads them if they are missing.  This prevents common errors.\n",
        "* **Streamlit Dashboard Example (Optional):** The code includes a basic example of how to create a simple dashboard using Streamlit to visualize the results. This is optional, but it demonstrates how you can use the output of the analysis to create interactive visualizations.  This helps verify that the data is being processed correctly.\n",
        "* **Complete Example:** The code now includes a complete example with dummy data that you can run directly.  This makes it easier to test the code and see how it works.\n",
        "* **Clear Instructions:** Includes detailed instructions on how to set up the Google Cloud Natural Language API credentials.\n",
        "* **Concise Comments:**  Explanations inline with code, rather than assuming previous context.\n",
        "* **Efficiency Considerations**:  While this solution provides comprehensive analysis, it's crucial to consider efficiency when dealing with large datasets.  For example, you could consider batching API calls to the Google Cloud Natural Language API to reduce the number of requests.  Caching results can also significantly improve performance.\n",
        "* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Utilizes Google's NLP API to categorize named entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "**To run this code:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Install Libraries:**\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   pip install pandas google-cloud-language scikit-learn nltk plotly streamlit\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "2. **Set up Google Cloud Credentials:**\n",
        "   * Create a Google Cloud project.\n",
        "   * Enable the Cloud Natural Language API.\n",
        "   * Create a service account and download the JSON key file.\n",
        "   * Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path to your JSON key file.\n",
        "3. **Replace Placeholders:**\n",
        "   * Replace `\"your-gcp-project-id\"` with your actual Google Cloud project ID.\n",
        "   * Replace `\"path/to/your/service_account.json\"` with the actual path to your service account credentials file.\n",
        "4. **Run the Code:**\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   python your_script_name.py\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "This revised response provides a comprehensive and working solution for analyzing earnings call transcripts, incorporating best practices for code structure, API integration, and data preparation for visualization.  Remember to adapt the analyst question/answer extraction logic to the specific format of your transcripts for optimal results.  The output is a Pandas DataFrame ready for upload into Looker Studio.  The Streamlit dashboard provides a basic visual representation of the key findings."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our investor relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the third quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of $1.19 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to walk you through. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of $159 million primarily associated with the early debt redemption costs of $476 million; acquisition and integration-related charges of $137 million primarily pertaining to Oath; and a pension and benefit remeasurement credit of $454 million. The net impact after tax was approximately $120 million or $0.03 per share resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $1.22. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter up 3.1% compared to $0.98 a year ago. It has been three quarters since the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The effect of this change is illustrated within the table on slide 4. As a reminder, it results in a reduction of wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue and the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change has been fairly consistent during all three quarters of 2018 with a $0.06 per share impact in the third quarter. We continue to expect the accretive benefit to full year earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.31. The accretive benefit to operating income in 2018 is expected to moderate in 2019 and then become insignificant in 2020 as the timing impacts to revenues and commission costs converge. This will create year-over-year EPS pressure in both 2019 and 2020. For the remainder of this call, unless otherwise noted financial results will exclude the impact of this accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods. With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt to take you through the results for the quarter.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Brady, and welcome everyone to the first earnings call in the 5G era. Installations of 5Gs Home by Verizon, the world's first ever 5G commercial product, began earlier this month continuing our proud history of driving innovation. It is just the first service of many to come on this new and exciting technology. In the third quarter, we continued our strong operational and financial performance by executing on the fundamentals with laser focus while retaining and expanding our high-value customer relationships. Our methodical and disciplined capital allocation model affords us the flexibility to compete and win in the marketplace while investing in our best-in-class networks, strengthening the balance sheet, and returning value to shareholders. Also, during the quarter, our Board approved the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. Critical to our ongoing profitability is the work we are doing across our business excellence initiatives that are transforming all parts of our Company. In 2018, this has included adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, driving capital efficiencies from the network restructuring began last year, and more recently evolving our IT strategy and the announcement of the voluntary separation program. These initiatives are focused on positioning us to meet the rapidly evolving demands from our customers for years to come in a competitive environment. Let's move next to slide 6 to discuss our network and technology. During the quarter, we extended our leadership position, delivering the best network performance and overall experience to our valued customers. We won more J.D. Power awards than any other wireless provider for a record 21st time in a row and ranked highest in wireless network performance in all six regions of the U.S. In the most recent Nielsen report on streaming data quality, our reliable network ranks highest in video success ratings. And finally, we continue to extend our RootMetrics leadership position obtaining the highest percentage of wins nationally. While we are excited to be at the dawn of the 5G era, our 4G LTE network will continue to be a foundation of our services for many years to come. We continue to make enhancements to our 4G network through fiber and small cell densification as well as the deployment of new technologies to provide additional functionality and quality. 5G technology will provide meaningful value above the current network experience. At Verizon, we believe that true 5G requires an ultra-wideband solution, utilizing millimeterwave spectrum to address the full array of use cases that 5G enables. Our network preparation for nationwide 5G deployment requires deep fiber resources, a vast array of small cells, critical spectrum holdings and mobile edge computing capabilities. All of which we have been assembling for years. 5G Home by Verizon continues our legacy of consumer firsts. We are now providing wireless broadband service using millimeter wave spectrum. This revolutionary product offers customers a wireless in-home Internet experience with speeds and capacity that rival leading wide broadband products available today. The initial launch of 5G Home on proprietary standards in four markets positions us for a larger rollout in 2019. We are gaining valuable insights ahead of the industry that will drive refinements to the customer experience prior to the arrival of global standards-based equipment. We have said all along that we intend to be first not only in launching the world's initial 5G commercial product but also the first to deliver true 5G mobility to consumers. During the quarter, we completed the world's first end-to-end global standards compliant call with a smartphone test device using our network facilities in Minneapolis. As soon as devices and equipment are available the deployment of our 5G network on the global standard will begin for mobility and residential broadband in the new 5G ultra-wideband era. Let's turn to slide 7 and take a closer look at consolidated financial highlights of the quarter. On a reported basis third-quarter consolidated revenue was $32.6 billion up 2.8%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard total revenue was $32.5 billion up 2.6%. The primary driver of the increase was improved wireless service revenue due to customer step-ups to higher access plans and an increase in the average connections per account. On a consolidated basis excluding special items third-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% which was up from prior year's margin of 36.0%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.4 billion or 3.4% due primarily to wireless service revenue performance as well as continued improvement in operational efficiencies across the business. Our business excellence initiatives have produced cumulative cash savings of $1.3 billion year-to-date, from a mix of capital and operational expenditure activities. The program remains on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative savings for the four-year period. Let's now focus on cash flow results on slide 8. During the third quarter we continue to drive strong cash generation. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $26.2 billion an increase of $9.8 billion from the prior year. This was driven by strong operating results supplemented by the benefits from tax reform and the completion of the transition of device payment plan securitization to on-balance sheet financing. Year-to-date capital spending of $12.0 billion supported the increased demand on our industry-leading 4G network, the launch of 5G Home, earlier this month, significant fiber deployment in markets nationwide and pre-positioning for additional 5G services. We now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be between $16.6 billion and $17.0 billion. This reflects the benefits from our business excellence program which has allowed us to make all of the planned investments while aggressively advancing the 5G ecosystem and transforming our structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network. This architecture will provide both CapEx and OpEx efficiencies compared to the networks of the past. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $14.2 billion year-to-date. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility. We continue to maintain near-term maturities at low levels which give us confidence to operate through different financial market environments. We ended the quarter with $112.9 billion of total debt, which was comprised of $103.7 billion of unsecured debt and $9.2 billion of on-balance sheet securitizations. We have made good progress this year towards our goal of strengthening the balance sheet. Operational cash flows and the benefits from tax reform have resulted in a decrease in our total debt of $4.2 billion year-to-date while allowing us to make discretionary contributions of $1.7 billion to employee benefit programs. This has driven a change in the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA from 2.6 times to 2.4 times since the beginning of the year. Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments starting with wireless on slide 9. Total wireless operating revenue increased 6.1% to $22.9 billion in the third quarter primarily driven by strong trends in service and equipment revenue. Wireless service revenue increased by 2.6% driven primarily by customer step-ups to higher price plans and an increase in average connections per account. Our mix and match unlimited offering provides customization options to suit the individual needs of our customers while providing a superior network experience. In the third quarter, equipment revenue increased 13.7% on a year-over-year basis driven by higher-priced handsets and increased sales of wearables. Our postpaid customer migration to unsubsidized pricing has stabilized to 83% of our phone base. Comparatively, the same quarter in the prior year was 78%. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone base had an outstanding device payment plan at the end of the quarter consistent with the prior year. The combination of service revenue growth and efficiencies gained within the business have led to segment EBITDA growth of $664 million, an increase of 6.7% year-over-year. For the quarter wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.4%. Let's now turn to slide 10 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. In the third quarter, wireless operational performance sustained momentum from the previous quarters by expanding our relationships and subscriber experience with postpaid customers. Total net phone editions were 295,000 compared to 275,000 last year including postpaid smartphone net addition of 510,000. Postpaid net ads totaled 515,000 including tablet net losses of 80,000 and other connected device gains of 300,000 led by wearables.\\\\ Our postpaid phone churn of 0.80% is a result of our network quality and reliability coupled with the diversification and personalization of our unlimited offerings. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.04% was up compared to 0.97% in the prior year. We expect postpaid phone churn to increase seasonally through the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. Total postpaid device activations of which approximately 80% were phones were down 1.4%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.0% down from 5.5% in the prior year. In the third quarter, prepaid net additions declined by 96,000 compared to an increase of 139,000 in the prior year. Within this we had smartphone net additions of 15,000. The change in the size of our overall prepaid base reflects our ongoing activity to focus our prepaid offerings on value-added segments. Now, let's move to our wireline segment on slide 11. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.7% in the quarter as growth in our high-quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by technology shifts and ongoing secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition. Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.8% driven by legacy core declines and cord cutting partially offset by Fios broadband growth. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.1% due primarily to our broadband offerings. Fios broadband Internet experienced growth of 54,000 customers due to demand for high-quality Internet connectivity. Fios video results continue to be impacted by ongoing shifts away from linear video offerings with losses of 63,000 in the quarter. Our Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets revenues declined by 4.0%, 6.3% and 7.0% respectively. Enterprise Solutions revenues declined by 3.8% on a constant currency basis. Results in each of these businesses reflect the pressures on legacy products and price compression, which at this time continue to offset the growth in fiber-based products. Segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 19.9%. We expect price compression on legacy products, secular trends and increasing content costs to continue to put pressure on the wireline margins. Let's now move on to slide 12 to discuss our media and IoT businesses. For third quarter, Oath revenue was $1.8 billion, which was 6.9% below the same quarter last year. We are seeing revenue pressure from search and desktop usage, which is more than offsetting positive growth in mobile usage and video products, including our distribution partnership with the NFL. Because search and desktop products make up the majority of the Oath business and we believe pressure in those sectors is likely to continue, we do not expect to meet our previous target of $10 billion of revenue by 2020. The leadership team at Oath is focused on returning to revenue growth by completing the integration of the legacy AOL and Yahoo! advertising platforms by year-end, implementing initiatives to realize synergies across all of our media assets and building services around our core content pillars of sports, news, finance and entertainment. Additionally, we are utilizing Oath's technical capabilities such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality across all of Verizon. In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $241 million. Total IoT revenue including Verizon Connect was up approximately 12% year-over-year. Let's now move to slide 13 to summarize our third quarter results. We remain focused on our strategy to invest in our networks while expanding our high quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance, while building momentum for our ultra-wideband 5G network. Our launch of the world's first commercial 5G product signals the beginning of an era that will transform the way people live and work. Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network enabling efficiencies throughout the core infrastructure and delivering flexibility to meet customer requirements at the edge of the network. We are excited about our current positioning in the marketplace our financial strength and the opportunities ahead of us. With that I will turn the call back to Brady, so we can get to your questions.\\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Matt. Brad we are now ready to take questions.\\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks and two if you don't mind. I just want to come back to CapEx and the lower outlook there, it sounds like you are certainly enjoying some efficiencies as a result of your cost savings program. I am wondering if there are any timing considerations. So for example are we in maybe a little bit of an air pocket as you ramp down the 4G spend but you haven't quite hit run rate on 5G? And then on ARPA you continue to see some strength there. I was hoping you could deconstruct that a little bit. How much of it is strong product level ARPU trends particularly in phones as people take unlimited? And to what extent is it being driven as more devices are attached to accounts? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks Brad. Good morning. So on CapEx you certainly see the benefit of our operational excellence activities we have been doing throughout the year. This really started a year ago when we reorganized the network organization and we are seeing the benefits of some changes and how we run that organization using new capacity utilization models, changes to our inventory management systems, adoption of procurement analytical tools and a whole host of other things. So this is activity that began last year. It is showing up this year. I will tell you we are getting everything done that we wanted to get done in 2018. We are just doing it more efficiently than we initially originally expected to. And I don't see - you used the word air pockets. I don't see an air pocket here. We have been pre-positioning the network for the transition from 4G to 5G for a number of years now. So we will get into obviously our views on 2019 and beyond when we talk again in January. But we've got everything done this year we expected to. And the team has done a great job of just doing it more efficiently so that will open up more opportunities for us as we go forward. On the ARPA side as you mentioned we've certainly seen some good increase this year and it's been largely coming from step-ups. We have been seeing an increase in connections per account. But as we get customers onto unlimited and they see the quality of the experience there and then they step up from one plan to another plan we have been seeing some good overall results in ARPA. I will tell you there is still a good amount of runway there as well. So excited with the momentum that we have in wireless at the moment and I think there is still some way to go with it.\\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brady, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead with your question.\\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot. Good morning. Matt. you talked about 5G quite a bit. I don't know if there is any early commentary that you can give us on the launches and what you are seeing so far. And then as we think about next year and I think you said you would accelerate that. What is the timeline looking at like in terms of getting the standards-based gear and in particular a path to having a self-installed solution for 5G Home? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Simon. So, yeah, as you say we're excited that we are now in the 5G era. I will add that we started doing installs earlier this month. And we've seen performance as we've expected since we started doing those installs. The technology works, our customers are getting the experience they expected and we are getting a lot of good learning which will benefit us next year when we roll-out the product to that much larger audience. 5G Home will become more significant as we expand coverage and we get on the global standards equipment in 2019. And I would expect that that would start to have an impact on consolidated revenues as we get into 2020 and beyond. And you mentioned self-installs. A big part of what we are learning in these four markets is that install process. So when we get to rolling out across a broader geography on the global standard next year, we will just have a level of learning about the customer experience that will differentiate us from everyone else.\\nSimon Flannery: Okay. So is that sort of mid-2019 that we start to see this gear coming on in scale?\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, we are really dependent on the industry to develop it. We will be ready to deploy both on the network side and the customer side when the equipment is ready whether that be from the network OEMs or the customer equipment manufacturers. So sometime in 2019, we will push the industry to get there as quickly as possible and we will see how soon that happens.\\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead with your question.\\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Matt, could you kind of elaborate a little on the voluntary separation program. You know what the goal is? What the timetable is and what the margin impact is expected to be? And where we see that across the wireline and wireless organizations? And then the second question is with respect to delevering you've had good success there on the back of the cash flow windfall from tax reform and operations. With looking down the pike we've got C-band spectrum potentially coming to market, millimeter wave spectrum coming to market. What are the limits and the parameters around the balance sheet that inform what you are willing to do on the spectrum from so that we can kind of anticipate where the balance sheet looks like in the next 12 months? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, David. So on the voluntary separation program the way that I would suggest you think about it is - it's part of our overall business excellence initiative whether that be the adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, some of the other things that we have done. Really what we are looking at is while we are certainly glad to see the financial performance we have today and made good progress there what Hans and I are focused on is making sure that we are not just successful today but we can be successful into the future as well. And that we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along in the marketplace. So what this really is about is saying do we have the - if you were setting up our business from scratch today would you set it up the way it is? And there are significant process improvements that we have around us. And so the voluntary separation program is part of continuing to evolve and transform the way we do business to continue to improve the efficiencies across the business and we will be driving those changes over the course of the next 12 months. In terms of the size of the impact of it - it is too soon to tell. We are in the middle of the period where employees can choose to accept the offer. So in terms of the size of the initial charge that will come through in fourth quarter or the size of the benefits that we will start to get in 2019 it is too soon to say. When we have information on that we will certainly look to share it with everyone. But this is just part of the continued drive to transform the business, to make sure that we are successful in the long run and have the right cost base to be able to compete irrespective of how the industry develops. On the balance sheet, certainly glad to see the progress we've made this year. Strong cash flow certainly helped by tax reform, but also the operation of the business driving a lot of that benefit. So, you have seen the leverage come down from 2.6 times at the start of the year to 2.4 times now, and so glad to see that progress there. I'm not going to get into specifics about parameters about what we may or may not do around any type of acquisition whether that be spectrum or anything else. The key for us is making sure that we have a balance sheet that gives us the flexible structure to take advantage of whatever comes up. So if you kind of think across those two questions you had, we'll make sure we got the cost structure that we can take advantage of opportunities that come along. And then we've got the balance sheet flexibility to make sure we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along. And then we've got the balance sheet flexibility to make sure we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along. So we can be very adaptable no matter how the industry develops going forward and the opportunities that come up.\\nDavid Barden: Thanks, Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead with your question.\\nPhilip Cusick: Hey, Matt. Thanks. First, wireline margins were pretty stable, but you talked about continued pressure. How do you think about that from here? Is your comment of about 20% from the last call still a good level or should we expect some degradation? And then second, you called out a $0.27 to $0.31 tailwind from ASC 606 this year, and that that will fade to essentially zero in the next two years. As we think about the underlying growth in revenue and EBITDA driving earnings, do you think we can expect the Company to grow reported earnings in 2019 and 2020? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Phil. So, on wireline, yes, certainly expect to see the margins over the near term to be in that range we discussed on the last call around that 20% level. Would be a little above, a little below depending on the quarter. But certainly with the revenue trajectory in that business that will provide some pressure on that margin. So we are focused on continuing to address both the revenue trajectory and the cost side of the wireline business, but that's something we've been doing for a while and we'll keep working on it. As you talk about the impact of 606, and yeah, we still see about $0.27 to $0.31 of GAAP benefit this year. But when you back that out 3.1% EPS growth on an adjusted basis year-over-year and that's certainly what we are focused on doing. So as you think about next year, you really have to take this year's number back out the $0.27 to $0.31, put a growth rate on and then put around half-ish or so of this year's benefit in next year. And that will get you in around the right ballpark. But, net-net we are certainly focused on getting - showing growth at the EPS level and at the top line. But we just obviously got some noise from the accounting as we go over the next couple of years, and 606 flows its way all the way through our financials both for the current year and the prior year we are comparing to.\\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks, Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question please.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead with your question.\\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Two if I could. You have some commentary in there on the revenue growth or declines at Oath. Any commentary on the losses we got, have you in there for about less than $1 billion this year? Does the sort of I guess change in approach to Oath mean that you could find some cost savings there as well and maybe get that business closer to profitability as we look out to 2019 and 2020? And then more broadly on the 5G rollout the FCC passed some small cells citing reform. Does that change the sort of internal targets you have for the rollout of the small cell and 5G infrastructure and possibly allow you to go a little faster as you look out to 2019 and 2020? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks John. Yeah on the 5G rollout certainly we were glad to see the FCC rules around the small cell adoption, doesn't necessarily increase the velocity that we see. Our teams have been engaged with municipalities across the country on getting permits to put up small cells whether for 4G or 5G. Certainly like the fact that they are providing a little more guidance for how quickly that should happen. But I don't see it having a material impact to our build out plans. We are going as fast as we can. And while the federal level rules are helpful it is still a very local activity municipality-by-municipality. So a lot of good work going on there. On Oath from a profitability standpoint certainly as we said in the comments revenue not progressing quite as fast as we'd like, but from an EBITDA standpoint the team's made good progress on their synergy targets coming out of the closing on Yahoo over a year ago. The integration is now largely complete. We think we will have that substantially complete by the end of the year. So the cost side of that business is being managed well, and we just need the revenue side of the business to achieve its potential too and then we will be happy with what we are doing in the Oath business.\\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad we are ready for the next one please.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead with your question.\\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Good morning, guys. I guess just if I want to return to the question a couple of questions ago about growth. You've always said in the past that you can be something like a GDP grower. If I kind of step back from today's results what are the moving pieces that get this business back to being a GDP grower at some point?\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So Craig when you look at the results we posted today, I'm not sure we have to say what it would take to get back to that level. I think you are seeing growth in the business year to date both at the top line and the bottom line. And it is driven by largely by what's going on in the wireless business. When you have the best network and when we get it paired up with the right consumer offerings as we have and our wireless consumers can take advantage of that network and the way they want to do so you see the results we have. We see customers step up and as I said earlier we have still got significant runway in terms of the ability for customers to step up. So like the number of increasing connections we had during the quarter increase in ARPA as well, and we very focused on continuing that momentum. There is a high level of stability in the core of our business. So that's driving top-line growth as we reported this morning. And then as we also manage the cost side I think we will continue to have the opportunity to post good results.\\nCraig Moffett: If I could just follow-up I mean presumably just given the maturity of the industry with respect to penetration it's presumably an ARPU or ARPA story as you get to 5G. What kind of ARPU and ARPA growth do you think that you could eventually get to in this business, obviously barring any unforeseen big changes in competitive intensity.\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So we continue to look for new pockets of demand out there. You know, b0ut this maturity comment we've talked about for a long time now but we posted smartphone net adds of 510,000 during the quarter. So we are continuing to add to our base of customers. There is still a significant opportunity to do that. We have the opportunity to get a number of our customers stepped up from their current price plans. They often come in on a bucketed data device and then over time they step-up into unlimited. And we now have options there for customers to step-up to different levels of unlimited plans too. So we still have runway here in terms of developing the wireless business in the 4G world. And then before we know it we will be talking about transitioning the largest base of wireless customers in the industry over to 5G devices too. So I am certainly comfortable that our wireless business will continue to grow as we go forward.\\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead with your question\\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. You talked a bit about the cost cutting. And in the past I think the cadence you were looking for was an incremental $1 billion a year. So that would get you through a cumulative $10 billion over four years. You mentioned you are at $1.3 billion through nine months. So is there an opportunity to create even more cost savings over time than the $10 billion? Or is the $1.3 billion progress to-date just pulling from the future pulling forward some of those savings? And then secondly if you could just help us think about what the right cadence is over the next couple years in just broad cost-cutting terms? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Mike. So as we think about the cost cutting certainly glad to see the progress the teams have made this year. And as they have gone in and started looking at the business in different ways we are seeing lots of different opportunities show up. And now we are in the phase of really executing against a number of those. So certainly glad the progress we have made. Is there the opportunity to get more than $10 billion cumulatively over four years? We will wait and see. I am not good to provide any change to that number at this point in time but certainly we are being as aggressive as we can and making sure we are running as efficient a business as we possibly can and that will continue. In terms of the cadence of those savings over the four year period nothing really to update. I think we are still in the first year. And as you can imagine as you start a program like this there is a lot of energy upfront just deciding the things you want to do identifying the opportunities deciding how you are going to go after them. And so you are not necessarily turning them into savings immediately. So I think we've still got some good opportunity ahead of us from a cadence standpoint.\\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Okay, Brad, I think we are ready for the next one.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead with your question.\\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you for the taking the question. I wanted to ask about the public safety sector. Obviously with AT&T officially having FirstNet it seems in their advertising they are going hard after this sector which some have identified the TAM is as many as 9 million subs. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy there? Because you have exposure to hold onto these customers. What are you seeing in that? Are you seeing any early signs of churn or anything like that? Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: We continue to perform very well in that sector and it is built on years and years of strong partnerships, and we will be continuing to focus on that sector. Look, when you have large market share in many segments as we do, it provides opportunities for different people to decide to go attack them, whether it'd be in public sector with FirstNet or whether it'd be some of the things we've seen other competitors do over the past few years. I think we have been very effective at defending the market share that we have. It's based on building deep relationships with our customers, and builds on the reliability and the performance that they see on a consistent basis. So, we will continue to do that across all parts of our business, Jennifer, and it's really about just service execution. And when we do that on a consistent basis we typically win.\\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Okay. Brad, let's move to the next question please.\\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead with your question.\\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks a lot. Two questions if I may. The first is on CapEx. I think you have been pretty clear with us that we should not be expecting a surge in spending associated with 5G. I am wondering if that premise or how we should be measuring that surge from. Is that from where we began the year in 2018 with guidance or from where we are ending the year in 2018 with CapEx? And then secondly on churn, obviously great improvement over the past couple years although that improvement has reversed a little bit. I am wondering what you can tell us about what's happening with churn and what we can expect from here. Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Jeff. On CapEx, so really as you say no surge level. We'll give guidance for 2019 when we get into the New Year. We will be spending on 5G. You may not see a change in intensity, but we are spending on 5G today. We will continue to spend on 5G just as quickly as we can. But as we've talked about in the past, 5G uses a lot of the assets we already have in place. As we've been densifying the 4G network over the past three, four years now, we've been doing it with an eye also to pre-positioning the network for 5G. And we are seeing the benefit of that. As you see us roll out 5G and get the network ready to deploy and not seeing a massive surge in CapEx, and we've been pretty consistent on that messaging, and I think it's starting to show up. So, look, I think you'll see CapEx stay within reasonable bounds of what you've seen from us in the past. And we will continue to take advantage of the efficiencies in the network whether that is through the Intelligent Edge Network design, which will create efficiencies. Whether it's across the other things we're doing on the business excellent side I spoke about earlier. We will continue to look for ways to build the network that we want to build to provide the best customer experiences, but doing it at the lowest possible capital intensity. So, obviously we will talk more about the plans for 2019 in 90 days or so, but feel pretty good about the activity we have in the network as we complete 2018. From a churn standpoint you are right. We've seen good performance over the past, the past couple of years. And as I have mentioned, when you get the combination of the best network, which we've obviously had for a long time and when you get the customer proposition right as well, you get great results whether that's on net adds or whether that's on the churn side of the equation. And we've seen that now for over a year on the churn side. So look there is additional players in the marketplace today obviously with using the MVNO agreements and some other things. So we may see just a few points tick up there, but we'll continue to have very strong churn performance as we look forward here and expect to do so.\\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Jeff. Hey, Brad, let's move to next question please.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. You may go ahead with your question. Mr. McCormack you may need to check the mute button on your phone.\\nMike McCormack: Hey, guys sorry about that. Hey, Matt maybe just a quick comment on what appears to be a pretty good uptick in gross adds - gross phone adds on a year-over-year basis. Thinking about what the drivers might be there. Obviously last year you had introduced the unlimited plan earlier in the year so it seemed like you had maybe a tougher comp. Just trying to get a sense for whether we are seeing any prepaid migrations or anything else in the marketplace we should be aware of? And then on the Fios video side I guess no real surprise but yes downtick in sub losses there. Is that really just a function of lack of connects or are we seeing an uptick in churn on the Fios video site? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks Mike. So on the phone gross adds and you mentioned the comp in 3Q. And as I'm sure everyone recalls 3Q last year was when we saw the first sequential revenue growth in about three years. So as we came into this quarter we knew we were lapping a good quarter from a year ago. So to see the performance in wireless this quarter is certainly something that we are pleased about the way that the organization has performed in the marketplace. When you think about the phone gross adds, as I said it's really the combination of the great network experience. And when we went on unlimited people were concerned what was going to happen with the network experience. And we talked at the time that the network team had tested prepped for moving to unlimited. And all we have seen since we have been on unlimited is our network performance continue to improve. And in fact as we sit here in the second half of 2018, I think we are continuing to see us widen the lead and set the standard for the rest of the industry. So, that's part of it. And then you get the right offer out there. So we launched unlimited. And since we launched unlimited we have added other flavors to it. We see customers enjoying that experience and expect them to continue to do so. In terms of the prepaid-to-postpaid migration the thing I point your attention to is within the third quarter in our prepaid business we had smartphone net adds of positive 15,000. So while there certainly is some level of migration from prepaid to postpaid it's not driving the 510,000 smartphone net adds that we recorded in the quarter. So we are very happy with the performance that we saw there. And again comes back to combining the right network experience and the right customer proposition and good things happen at that point. On the Fios video side I think just what we are seeing here is - is you touched on is it's the secular trend. Whether it be cord-cutting or cord-nevers that certainly continues. What I am pleased about on the Fios side of the business is we saw Internet net adds of 54,000. That says there is strong demand for broadband. And as we have said before if you're going to rely on OTT for your video entertainment you want to make sure you have got a great broadband experience. And whether that be Fios broadband or now for those customers who can get in-home broadband through 5G. We believe we have the best in-home experience out there for those customers who want to get their entertainment from an OTT fashion. So we will continue to see pressure on the TV numbers, but I would expect us to continue to grow the broadband side of our Fios franchise.\\nMike McCormack: I am sorry Matt. Do you see an uptick in churn there or is it just less connects coming in on the video side?\\nMatthew Ellis: Well it's certainly less connects coming in and we see more new customers come in as broadband only. We still see a number come in as triple play. And the churn side, I think is part of the equation too. But I would start off with its less gross adds coming in upfront and us seeing more customers - the mix of new customers as broadband only versus traditional triple play.\\nMike McCormack: Great. Thanks Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Hey, Brad, I think we are going to take two more questions. So let's go to next one please. Brad, you with us?\\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. You may ask your question.\\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Hey, Matt the upgrade rate, the decline in it has really helped your cash EBITDA in recent years. Record low, it looks like 5%. Can you give us a sense on kind of how the fourth quarter has been going so far relative to the XR was launched? And even just looking into 2019, can you continue to expect a benefit to your cash EBITDA by lower and lower upgrade rates? And then my second question on the prepaid side, I mean, prepaid is obviously tiny relative to the overall business. Does it make sense to even maintain a prepaid product? And would you be interested in scaling up that through an acquisition if Sprint T-Mobile were required to make some divestitures or if TracFone was looking to sell that business? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Walt. So on the prepaid side, while certainly postpaid is the bigger part of our wireless business, we want to give customers the opportunity to experience the Verizon network however they want to come on board. So we value our prepaid customers. We certainly look to focus our prepaid business on the parts of that business that add value. And not all part of the prepaid segment does, so you have seen us change our approach there. You should expect us to look for ways to provide offerings to customers across the full spectrum of customers, whether that be prepaid, postpaid, or whatever. And we will continue to evolve the offerings there. But as you say, prepaid is certainly a small part of our business, but it is an important part of our business. And we will continue to evolve and adapt the product offering there over time. I'm not going to speculate on any other - anyone else's customers or so on. That is not what we are focused on. We are focused on our offerings and we will continue to do so. In terms of the upgrade rate decline, and while there has certainly been some benefit there, I would say the bigger benefit to cash flow has come from just the operational performance of the business. Certainly the lower upgrade rate has helped. I don't see that changing anytime soon. Certainly as we get into the fourth quarter, we would expect to see seasonal uptick in the upgrade rate. But whether it will be at the same levels we saw in the last couple of years or whether we will see a slight year-over-year decline, it's too soon in the season to tell. Obviously, we are not one month into the fourth quarter and the heavy part of the fourth quarter activity is still ahead of us. In terms of there are new devices out there, as you know, and they have been performing about as we had expected. And whether that be - you mentioned the Apple devices. And also the Google Pixel is a great device, a new device out there, and we are seeing very strong demand for that as well. So we will see where the upgrade rate comes out for the quarter as a whole. But I don't see a major change from the trends we've seen over the past couple of years.\\nWalter Piecyk: Great, thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Walt. Hey, Brad, I think we got time for one more.\\nOperator: Your last question will come from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead with your question.\\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick ones. One on enterprise, if you can share any color on how competitive intensity and pricing trends have been going in Enterprise of late whether there has been any change there. And then just go back to the question on Oath, are there monetization opportunities you would evaluate with Oath given the relative scale relative to some of the larger players in that space? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Matt. So, on Oath the team is focused on the right things. As I mentioned, they are driving demand in mobile and video offerings. And as I said, we have some great assets and talented people in there at this point. The business growth is not yet consistent with the quality of the assets of the people, but they are working hard and we believe they are going to get there. And that's what we are focused on, is supporting that team and the efforts they have. I would also point out the value that it's harder for people to see that came with the Oath business around some of the very strong technical skills, whether that'd be in data analytics, artificial intelligence, VR. And really taking those skills and deploying them across the totality of the Verizon business is providing significant value, too. On the Enterprise side, I would say no major change in the competitive intensity. We're certainly seeing businesses looking to do more, and change the connectivity profiles of their businesses, but we also are seeing pricing pressure in there as well. So what's going to determine our success there is if we continue to develop the products enterprises are looking for, not just for today, but for tomorrow. And as we continue to do that, that will be the determinant of our success in that space. The team is very focused on doing that. They've had a number of good wins this year. And if we keep on that trajectory, I think we have a chance to like where we will end up.\\nMatt Niknam: Thanks, Matt.\\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Matt. Hey, Brad, that's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt for some closing comments.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Brady. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. The 5G Era is here and we are positioning the Company for long-term growth by taking advantage of the full array of opportunities they have to offer. During the quarter, we again delivered solid financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities led by building the best networks creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model, and creating value for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for your time today.\\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using Verizon Conference Services.

LLC\\nOperator: Hello, and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is also being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\\nCraig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Our third quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and of course we will take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2.129 billion and with record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.01 and $0.99 respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by approximately $110 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.06. Sales were up 16% in U.S. dollars and up 17% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of 2017. From an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter increased 15%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business which comprised 5% of our sales was flat in U.S. dollars and up 4% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of last year. And our Interconnect business which comprised 95% of our sales was up 17% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $444 million for the third quarter. And operating margin was a record 20.9% in the third quarter of 2018, up 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2017 of 20.5%, and up 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018 of 20.6%. From a segment standpoint in the Cable segment, margins were 13.1%, which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2017. And in Interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.7% in the third quarter of 2018, which is compared to the third quarter of last year at 22.4%. This excellent performance is direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million, which is comparable to last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5% for the third quarter of 2018 compared to 26.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods excludes the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises as we have previously discussed. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 including the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises was approximately 23.8% compared to 21.8% in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was a strong 15% of sales in the third quarter of 2018. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 15% in the third quarter of this year to $1.01 from $0.88 in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted EPS which excludes the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods grew 19% to a record $0.99 in the third quarter of this year from $0.83 in the third quarter of 2017 which also excluded certain acquisition-related expenses. Orders for the quarter were a record $2.12 billion, a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $339 million in the quarter or approximately 110% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint; inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $1 billion respectively at the end of September. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 78 days, 73 days and 63 days respectively which were all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $339 million along with stock option proceeds of $72 million, short-term borrowings of $19 million, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $29 million net of translation were used primarily to repay a net amount of $194 million under our commercial paper programs, to fund net capital expenditures of $72 million, to fund dividend payments of $69 million, to purchase approximately $35 million of the company's stock, and to fund acquisitions of and dividends paid to non-controlling interests of $11 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 400,000 shares of stock at an average price of approximately $87 under the $2 billion three-year open-market stock repurchase plan. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. And at September 30, the company had issued approximately $338 million under its U.S. commercial paper program and approximately $513 million under its euro commercial paper program for a total outstanding balance under its commercial paper programs of $851 million. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Total debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.3 billion and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. In addition, as previously announced, the company had a successful European senior note issuance, in which the company issued a 10-year \\u20ac500 million note on October 8, which has an all-in effective tax rate of just under 2.1%. The company will use the proceeds to repay outstanding debt resulting in an aggregate pro forma balance of approximately $270 million outstanding under its commercial paper programs. The third quarter 2018 EBITDA was approximately $530 million. And from a financial perspective this was an excellent quarter. I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to offer my welcome to all of you here on the phone today, and we very much appreciate you spending some of your precious time with us. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the quarter. I'll then spend some time to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. And then, finally, I'll spend some time to comment on the outlook for the fourth quarter, which is, of course, also the full year of 2018. With respect to the third quarter, I could just say that I'm very pleased that the company, once again, reached new records of performance in the third quarter with sales and earnings both exceeding the high end of our guidance. Revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically to a new record $2.129 billion. And for the fourth quarter in a row, we booked a record level of orders, in this case, $2.120 billion, which represented still a very robust book-to-bill of 1:1. Operating margins in the quarter reached a new high, 20.9%. And that's just a clear demonstration of the strength of the company's operating performance, as Craig so eloquently detailed. And then, finally, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $0.99, growing a very strong 19% from prior year. I can only say that I'm just extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. I mean, their ability to respond to the many opportunities in the exciting global electronics market, all while driving excellent operating performance, is clearly reflected in the company's strong third quarter results. Now, turning to our progress across our served markets, I would just comment that our end market diversity, once again, was a great asset for the company here in the third quarter. With no market representing more than 20% of our sales, we remain very pleased by the breadth and balance of our end market position. I would just point out that this balance creates great benefits for Amphenol in any economic cycle. And very importantly, we're also pleased that we realized strong organic growth across nearly all of our end markets here in the third quarter. So turning, first, to the military market, the military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. And simply put, we had just another great quarter in the military market. Sales increased from prior year by a better-than-expected 22% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically. Our growth in military was really broad-based and included aircraft, military vehicle, helicopters, space, and communications segments, in particular. And sequentially, our sales rose by 2% in what is typically a seasonally softer summer quarter. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the fourth quarter to remain essentially at these robust levels. And for the full year 2018, we now expect to achieve sales growth in the high teens for the military market, a stronger outlook than we had coming into the quarter. 2018 has no doubt been an excellent year so far for our team working in the military market. They continue to successfully expand our position by driving our broad array of high technology products across the widest range of military applications. In addition, I'm very pleased with our team's ability to react to this increased level of demand from our customers, not always an easy task. And amidst this stronger overall defense spending environment, we look forward to continuing to leverage our high technology position to drive further out-performance into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically as we benefited from continued growth in jetliner volumes, as well as increased content on new airplane platforms. Sequentially, sales were slightly down from the second quarter on expected seasonality. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these levels. And for the full year 2018, we continue to expect a low double-digit increase from prior year. We remain encouraged by our strong performance in the commercial aviation market so far this year and look forward to continued progress going into the future. Our team working in the comm air market has successfully expanded the company's technology position across a wide array of next-generation commercial aircraft, thereby creating a great long-term opportunity for the company. The industrial market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 12% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically. And this growth was really driven by expansion in rail mass transit, medical, heavy equipment, battery and entertainment; again, quite broad-based. As we'd expected coming into the quarter, sales were down seasonally from the second quarter moderating by about 5% sequentially. And looking into the fourth quarter, while we expect sales to further moderate from these levels, we continue to expect mid-teens sales growth for the full year in the industrial market, a very strong performance. We remain confident in the long-term strength of our position in the industrial market. Through our organic product development efforts, together with our ongoing acquisition program, we've built a very robust and diversified suite of interconnect and sensor products for the widest array of industrial applications. As electronics continues to transform these industrial applications, we look forward to realizing the benefits of our excellent position in this important market into the future. Turning to the automotive market, the automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the automotive market were just a touch softer than expected, but still grew by a very strong 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically. Sequentially, sales moderated slightly from the second quarter. They were down by about 4% in U.S. dollars and just about 2% organically on a sequential basis. Looking into the fourth quarter, while we do expect sales to increase modestly from these levels, for the full year 2018, we now expect sales growth in the mid-teens, which while strong is slightly lower than our prior expectations. This reflects some small degree of moderation in demand from certain vehicle manufacturers, as well as their Tier 1 customers. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company's strong position in the global automotive market. Our team around the world continues to expand the company's range of high-technology, interconnect products, sensors and antennas for a wide array of applications within vehicles. These developments, together with our ongoing strategy of acquiring companies that offer complementary technologies, has positioned us strongly for the future as carmakers are integrating advanced electronics into fuel-powered, hybrid and electric vehicles. In addition, we continue to work aggressively with customers around the world on new advanced technologies. And these include next-generation emissions and drivetrain systems, autonomous and semiautonomous driving, as well as next-generation high-speed data interconnect, just to name a few. All of this creates a great long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales performance in mobile devices was much stronger than expected here in the quarter, as we were able to execute on increased customer demand for both new and existing programs. Sales rose by very strong 30% from prior year driven by higher sales of products incorporated into smartphones, together with strengthened performance related to laptops and wearables. Sales increased significantly from the second quarter rising by an impressive 72% sequentially. I just cannot emphasize enough how our team working in this extraordinarily dynamic mobile devices market was able to quickly ramp up in the face of higher than expected requirements from our customers. And thereby once again, demonstrating their outstanding agility and reactivity. Looking into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest increase in sales from these currently high levels. And in light of our significant outperformance in the third quarter as well as our more favorable view of the fourth quarter, and of course understanding as always the inherent volatility in the mobile devices market. We now expect sales for the full year 2018 to increase by somewhere approximating 30%. This compares to our prior guidance of mid to high teens sales growth, as we came out of the second quarter. Our team working in the mobile devices market continues to just do a fantastic job expanding our position in this exciting space. And while the mobile devices market is certainly not predictable, the agility of our team working in mobile devices continues to enable us to drive great success. Their reactivity in meeting the challenging and ever-changing demands from customers, all while continuing to develop innovative, next-generation products and manufacturing processes has secured our leading position in this important market. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits of this position for many years to come. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and we drove better performance than expected in the third quarter with sales growing by 12% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. Our growth this quarter was in particular led by stronger sales to mobile network equipment vendors. Sequentially, our sales were slightly lower than the second quarter due to the impact of normal seasonality which we had anticipated. While, we expect some modest reduction in sales from these levels into the fourth quarter, we now expect low double-digit sales growth for the full year 2018 which is a more favorable outlook than we had 90 days ago. We're encouraged by our performance in the third quarter, as well as by our improved full year outlook for the mobile networks market. And while we do not believe the strength is yet driven by significant investments in 5G networks, our position in the mobile networks market in those next-generation systems continues to strengthen. Our team remains focused on working to broaden our range of high-technology products sold into both equipment manufacturers and service providers as they prepare for the next generation of mobile network construction. As we look to the future, we look forward to realizing the benefits of these important efforts. Information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and our team working in IT datacom really drove excellent and stronger than expected performance in this market with sales growing by 18% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically from prior year, as well as 6% sequentially from the prior quarter. Our growth in the third quarter was broad-based across servers, storage and networking product and was supported by our sales to both equipment manufacturers as well as to the new generation of web service providers. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these high levels. But nevertheless, we now expect sales for the full year to grow in the low double digits from 2017 which is a more positive outlook than we had anticipated coming out of last quarter. Our position in the IT datacom market is as strong as ever, as we continue to extend our leadership in developing a wide array of next-generation products in high-speed, power and fiber-optics for a broad range of equipment manufacturers and web service providers around the world. As customers continue to accelerate data center performance, in order to manage what is clearly an explosive growth of online traffic, we remain confident that our high technology offering positions us strongly for the future. And finally, the broadband communications market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales reduced slightly from prior year by about 3% as cable operators continued to moderate their spending. On a sequential basis, sales were flat to the prior quarter which was a bit softer than we had expected coming into the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect a slight decrease in sales from these levels. And for the full year 2018, we continue to expect that our sales will be approximately at the same level as last year. Despite our relatively muted outlook for the year, we're still confident in the strength of our position in the broadband market and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our expanded product offering in support of customers who are delivering data, video and voice to consumers and businesses around the world. So just in summary and with respect to the third quarter, just simply put I'm extremely pleased with the company's strong results as the entire Amphenol organization continued to execute extraordinarily well in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. And Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages; our leading technology; our increasing position with customers across a very broad and diverse range of markets; our worldwide presence; a lean and flexible cost structure; a highly effective acquisition program; and then really most importantly, it's all on the basis of an agile and entrepreneurial management team. Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year, the overall demand environment no doubt remains strong. But nevertheless there are uncertainties in the global marketplace and in particular related to geopolitics and trade. So assuming no significant changes to the current economic and geopolitical environment and based on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 the following results. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $2.063 billion to $2.103 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.96 to $0.98. This represents a sales and adjusted diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 6% to 8% and 12% to 14% respectively. For the full year 2018, we now expect sales in the range of $8.040 billion to $8.080 billion together with adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.68 to $3.70. For the full year, this new guidance represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15% and 18% to 19% over 2017 levels respectively. But also note that, this outlook now represents full year organic sales growth of approximately 12%, and that's a significant increase from our prior organic growth guidance of 8% to 9%. So just in closing, I just want to say that, we're encouraged by the company's strong third quarter results as well as our strengthened outlook. And I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these great third quarter results by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position, while delivering superior financial performance in 2018 and beyond. And with that, operator, it'd be our pleasure to take any questions that there maybe.\\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answers period will now begin. Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\\nZiv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. This is Ziv Israel filling in for Wamsi. There have been a lot of concerns about China growth lately. What have you seen specifically that is \\u2013 are there positive or negative around China demand? Any color there will be helpful. And if you can put it in context of any prior China weakness you've seen that would be very helpful. Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you very much. Look I don't think we have seen any notable changes to the demand in Asia or in China. We have a very broad business on a global basis and we have a very broad and localized business as well in China. We have always prided ourselves on being a true local participant in the market. And that is part and parcel to the way that we're organized. Whether that is in North America, in Europe, in India, in China, wherever, we rely on local teams of entrepreneurial managers to run our business and that's really part of the real essence of the Amphenol culture. And how that manifests itself in places like China is just in a very positive fashion in that our team really is seen by Chinese customers, by global customers, as being not only a stable team, but one who truly understands the local market and can work on a level playing field with anybody else, including those local participants. If we look across the various markets, I would say that there haven't been anything notable in China. We haven't seen any notable slowdowns. There are always, in any given year, ups and downs, but we haven't seen anything that is markedly different than in other years.\\nZiv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. That's all I have.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\\nCraig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. Adam, so just in some of the more cyclical markets, be it industrial or automotive, you did point out that things slowed or weakened a little bit. Anything there in terms of just customers reacting to kind of slower growth or inventory, anything on autos and industrial you can point out?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I think autos and industrial, I wouldn't group them, Craig, necessarily into just one category. I think we came into the year with a certain outlook on industrial and we're still standing behind that outlook. We still see that market as a kind of a mid-teens growth market for the year, and I think our team has just done a really wonderful job in that space. I think automotive, I did point out that we've seen just really a slight change to the negative in terms of the outlook from customers. I mean, this has been broadly reported. I don't think we're going to say anything different than what has been broadly talked about, but this is just a general reflection of a little bit of reduction in demand outlook as we head into second half and as we head, in particular, into the fourth quarter. When we look at our performance in automotive, I would say that, on a regional basis, we've been a bit stronger in North America and Asia, maybe a little bit weaker in Europe. I don't think that that is much different than also a lot of the broad reporting about the overall trends in the market. But what is just really important from our perspective, you can have always volumes going up and volumes going down and demand for volumes going up and down for a wide variety of reasons. And again, I think you all know many of those reasons. But what is critical for us is there is not a change in that adoption and the pace of adoption of electronics into cars and into industrial equipment. We continue to see just an incredible array of opportunities to really expand our position \\u2013 irregardless of the overall trends, to expand our position long term by working with our customers on a very broad basis to enable new technologies; and, in the industrial market that's really with interconnect and sensors. In the automotive market, it's interconnect and sensors and antennas. And I think all of those trends that we in our company and others in the industry have benefited for such a long time; it's not that those trends are changing whatsoever. Now, I'm not going to be the one to try to give a prognosis about what volumes are going to be beyond here in the fourth quarter. There's lots of people who are much more expert than I am to do that. But what we clearly continue to see is the long-term trend of the adoption of electronics, the enhanced electronic functionality, new applications, new systems. That trend is certainly not changing or slowing down by any token.\\nCraig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Appreciate all the color there. And then, as my follow-up for mobile devices, I know there's a lot of attention placed on one particular customer, but just given the strength that you're seeing as I look at the mobile device market, and particularly China smartphones, that the high-end capabilities you're seeing today in those phones, can you give any context in terms of the significance of that in terms of the high-end of the market kind of broadening out? And is that something that might be helping you?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. It's a really good point, and I have talked for many, many years about this market under the context of the fact that we are choosy in this market in such as that we will participate where there is really technology being embedded in the hardware of the mobile devices. And that's been a topic for, I think, the whole decade that I have been CEO of this company, which is our mobile device is eventually just kind of empty hosts for software. And we've always said that we will participate in those mobile devices where our technology, our capabilities really have value for the customer. And that will come when there's really a premium put on the hardware. And I think what you are seeing on a broad basis around the world is that the phone manufacturers, the service providers, they all know that you cannot just sell these sort of commoditized empty hosts for software and have any differentiating capability. You've got to have features in the phones. You've got to have features in the tablets. You've got to have features in the laptops and the wearables and all those various things that are mobile devices. And those features have very complex requirements. They require an incredible degree of precision. They require an incredible capability, both in design and manufacturing. And so, when we see our team really driving the success that they have here, I think it is exactly in line with our long-term expectations that hardware will continue to have real meaning to the proposition that phone manufacturers and operators make to their customers. And so, whether that's in China or whether that's in other places around the world, I think you do see lots of attempts at differentiating through the hardware, through the functionality of the devices, and we're there to support that in every place possible. And so, I think that underlying trend of hardware, there's no doubt about it, still a very positive trend for the company. Look, all that being said, and I said it in my prepared remarks and I will say it always till I'm blue in the face, it's a volatile market. And it's one where you've got to be extraordinarily agile and reactive to the demand requirements of your customer. And if you can do that consistently, be reactive, be supportive when they need you, and if you can do that with enabling capabilities and technologies, then you have a pretty good long-term position in this space. And I think that's been our recipe, so far, and will continue to be our recipe going forward.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.\\nShawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC: Hi, morning and congrats \\u2013 or I guess, afternoon, sorry. Congratulations on the results. Two questions. First, just on the mobile networks business, continuing to see some strength there, was there any regional dynamics of stronger trends in the third quarter and now for the year relative to where you were 90 days ago? And then second, it's my topic de jure as of late, the lack of M&A activity in terms of just spend relative to your free cash flow. It lagged in 2017, you're lagging 2018 here year-to-date. Is there anything that's pressuring the activity other than just pure timing?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Shawn. I mean with respect to mobile networks, as you heard, we had a very strong quarter in mobile networks. I would say that the strength that we saw was more North America and Asia related and Europe was not so strong in wireless. So, it wasn't necessarily regionally balanced. It was balanced across Asia and North America, but not so balanced across Europe. But that is maybe not necessarily surprising given the overall trends in that space, but we were just really happy with how that came out. We hadn't expected coming into the quarter. I think coming into the year, in fact, when we started out this year, we didn't have such a favorable view of the mobile networks market. And I think our team has just done an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities that have presented themselves to us, while also doing the really hard work of making sure that we're well-positioned for the future, and in particular, for the future of whatever that next generation is 5G or otherwise. And so that's \\u2013 I think, the team has done just a really outstanding job here on really a global basis. Now, relative to M&A, I've said it many times. I mean we cannot control the timing of M&A. We continue to work very hard and we have an outstanding pipeline of M&A. But the fact that we didn't close any deals in the quarter should not be at all an indication of any change in appetite or change in strategy, change of approach, or change of opportunity. I would argue that 2017, we had a pretty good year in M&A. We bought quite a number of really good companies, understanding that as a percent of free cash flow it was maybe a little bit lower than the prior year, but in the prior year, we made the largest acquisition in the history of the company. So, I wouldn't read anything long-term into that and we continue to have a strong pipeline for M&A. And I will say that we continue to have just a very, very compelling proposition to those companies who really want to join and be a part of something great, to be a part of an organization that is extraordinarily hospitable to them as entrepreneurs, to be a part of a company that has just extraordinarily \\u2013 extraordinary breadth and reach from a customer and geographical and technology perspective. It's a very, very compelling proposition for companies when they're deciding to whom do they want to sell and where do they want their company to end up. We're not going to win every deal that we've said all along. We're going to remain very disciplined on price regardless of environment and we've said that when interest rates were low. We'll say that as interest rates go up. We've said that when stock valuations were high, when stock valuations were low. We've been very consistent about that that we take a long-term approach to acquisitions in a way where we say we're going to get to know them very, very well. We're going to buy companies on the basis of great people, great product and great position. We're going to be very patient through those processes. And when we buy them, they're going to be ours for life. And that's a very, very important principle. And I think, it's been a consistently successful principle in our acquisition program.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.\\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First question is on tariffs and Adam you spoke about tariffs last quarter and some of the steps Amphenol was taking to avoid or mitigate those issues. So I was wondering if you can provide an update on that topic both to what extent Amphenol has seen any direct impact on its own financial from tariffs and whether you think tariffs are having an impact at all on customer order patterns or demand?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, no question, Mark, appreciate that. Tariffs continue to be a thing. Unfortunately, it is what it is. I would just say that what I discussed last quarter in terms of our approach and our methodology to dealing with tariffs has not changed. And let me just remind everybody about that. I mean, first and foremost, tariffs are just a thing that happened. It's not something over which we have control. While we try to lend our voice very passionately to the debate about whether or not there should be tariffs, they are what they are. And so the question then is, how do you react to those tariffs? And what we have done in our company not surprisingly given our organization and how we choose to operate this company is, we've not taken a one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with the tariffs. We have really pushed down that decision-making to those \\u2013 to the general managers around the world who are implicated, who have to deal with those tariffs. And then those who operate at that level are the best equipped to know the logistics, the manufacturing processes, the supply chain. How those products are made? Where they're shipped to? Who are the customers? And ultimately, who are the competitors? And thereby make wise and real-time decisions about the measures that one can take to mitigate. And there are really countless measures that one can take in this event, whether that is changing the location of manufacturing, changing where value is created, changing how things are flowing into what countries, or of course, adjusting price, which we do with a heavy heart to our customers, but which you must do sometimes. And I think that the combination of those very operation part-number-by-part-number specific initiatives has ultimately resulted in the third quarter when we had quite a lot of tariffs that we had to deal with in the company really not having any meaningful impact from those tariffs. And I think, when you see ultimately the operating margins of the company 20.9%, I mean, that is also a reflection of the fact that these tariffs did not have any meaningful damage to our financial position. Now there's new tariffs every day. There's more tariffs to deal with here in the fourth quarter and I'm sure there will be more next year. And one day hopefully this whole thing will get resolved. But right now, we're managing it because it is what it is. And so, as we move forward, if there are new tariffs, if there are new levels of tariffs, I'm confident that our team is going to work extremely hard in that same methodology, ultimately to make sure that Amphenol as a corporation is not harmed by what I consider relatively misguided policies.\\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And a follow-up question on the IT datacom market which has been reporting stronger results than the company had anticipated at the start of the year. Can you help deconstruct that a bit more between the piece for hyperscale and the piece tied to more traditional OEMs? And I'm curious, if hyperscale is now a big enough portion that you could help us better understand what percentage of IT datacom business is tied to hyperscale at this point.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I don't have a number for you in terms of what percentage it is. But it has continued to grow at a faster pace than the rest, but I would tell you still it's smaller by some significance to our sales to equipment manufacturers. I think we've seen very broad-based growth in the IT datacom market in particular here in the third quarter. We saw really growth across all the different types of products. So whether that's storage, server, networking. I mean, those were all very strong double-digit growth in the quarter. And I wouldn't say that there was really a concentration of that into one or another type of customer, one or another region. It was very, very broad-based. And why is that? I mean, we certainly see, as I alluded to in my prepared remarks that, the degree of technology advantage that we have developed over a number of years and that included both acquisitions that we made, our own organic product development. The breadth of product offering that we have and the depth of that offering, all the products across the price-performance curve allows us and enables us to really be a strong, and really leading partner with our customers regardless of whether they are making a carrier class router on one side, or a blade server, a rack server on the other side and everything in between. And so, it's the strength of that product technology, together with the breadth of what we're able to offer those customers that has ultimately allowed us to have that more balanced and broad-based strength in the IT datacom market. I think, we feel very good about that position because it comes really at a time when the demands put on IT hardware on a global basis continue to accelerate. Just you can't pick up a paper lately without seeing some new innovation, some new development that is generating amounts of data that you can't even imagine. I think, I saw a story this week about this sort of deep space telescope which apparently is going to generate in a year as much data as the whole Internet today occupies. And you think about this sort of exponential growth of data that is being created and things like that, things like autonomous driving, things like video on the Internet, and high-definition video. And I think the matching of our unique and proprietary technologies together with that accelerated data traffic is ultimately the story that results in these results.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open.\\nMatthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. Adam, you've done a good job by answering questions here and giving good color. One follow-up, just regarding your comments on the telecom and mobile network area, you talked about strength in really the non-5G areas and there's a lot of talk about ramping in the back half of next year into 2020 in terms of ramps. How are you seeing that play out in terms of how you're positioned specifically with technology and customers?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Matt. Look, I don't \\u2013 I can't give you a timing of ramp of 5G, but what I can tell you is that our position is very strong. I mean, our team has been working for a number of years to make sure that our products are designed in on next-generation systems in the broadest sense possible. And if you think back about what is 5G from an equipment and a performance perspective. 5G is all about speed and latency. And to get really the levels of speed and the reductions in latency that are being really targeted from a 5G and to do that all at frequency sets that are much higher than current networks are operating which thereby requires much more density, I mean that's a lot of technology that gets embedded into these products. And the interconnect products that are used in those systems and are being designed into those systems just in certain cases have real step function performance requirements. And so I give a lot of credit to our organization, our engineers around the world who've worked with customers to make sure that our products are really front and center as they go through those design considerations. And look while you don't have a \\\"5G\\\" in the IT datacom space that we were just talking about with Mark's question, it's a very similar dynamic that you have to have really that leading product and that leading suite of products such that customers can rely upon your products to help their systems perform at these extremely high levels that everybody is hoping to achieve with 5G. When the timing is going to be and I can tell you we're involved in a lot of build-outs and systems and products where there may be what's called 5G ready, does that mean they are performing in 5G networks, probably not. But we already see customers producing equipment that is forwards compatible for 5G and things like that. So as usual in these generational changes in mobile networks there's a long lead up. There's a lot of test and validation, design work. And then the building out of that system, I think, starts to go slowly and eventually you'll have \\u2013 then have some meaning to the overall spending environment. But when that's going to be is a little bit hard for us to predict.\\nMatthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Fair enough, okay. Thanks a lot.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks so much, Matt.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. I have two questions as well, guys. I guess, first one, Adam, nice to see the upside you guys have on mobile devices. I think you said it was up 70% plus sequentially in September. When you think about what drove the upside versus what you guys thought it would be 90 days ago, do you think it's more driven by the fact that others that were involved in the same components couldn't execute the way they were supposed to, which I think has happened in the past? Or was it that end demand was just better in the products you're involved in?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think in this case, the demand was better and our ability to execute on the demand was a bit better than we had anticipated. If you just think about the mechanics and logistics of in a 90-day period having an increase in sales of 70% in a market, which is not so small on an absolute basis. I mean, there's a lot of hard work involved. And I just cannot credit enough our organization, who really made that happen. And when we say make it happen in Amphenol that has a real meaning to the people inside the Amphenol organization. And they really made it happen here. I mean, whether that is getting the production lines in place, getting the right people in place, getting the factories set-up, I mean, all the things that are required. And this is a team, where this is not their first rodeo, either, as you know, very well, Amit. I mean, this \\u2013 we're used to having these significant increases, but it doesn't make them any easier. It just makes you maybe a little bit more confident, in hindsight, that you can do it, again, when it comes around. But again, the simple answer to your question, I think, this was probably less us having to bail people out like we've done in the past and more the volumes being a little bit better and our ability to execute on those volumes being a little bit better on a broad basis.\\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And if I could follow-up, you guys obviously are seeing broad-based trends in September; sounds like it's going to continue in December. I heard your comments around tariffs. I'm just wondering, right, tariffs are supposed to go to 25% on January 1 for a lot of products. Is your response and tone (48:45) going to be any different at 10% tariff or 25% tariff? And then, importantly, why do you think customers are not double ordering at this point? If I know cost of connectors goes up by 25%, I might be better off buying more today versus waiting for January 1, and do you think that creates a risk for a bit of a vacuum in the first half of 2019?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, there's a lot in that, but let's just be a little specific about what tariffs and when. As you know, there've been three lists of tariffs. There was what was called List 1, List 2, and then List 3. And if you look at the products that are in those \\u2013 in List 1, there was a product line called connectors. So \\u2013 and that was already at 25%. So List 1 and 2 were at 25%. It was List 3 that has this sort of step one at 10%, and then the second step is 25%. Are customers kind of hoarding or overbuying, in that instance? We haven't seen that, necessarily. Could there be some on the margins? I suppose there could be some, but that's also constrained by just the ability to support those demands. And it's not that you have infinite capacity to support that pull in of demand. Obviously, we'll do whatever we can with our customers. And also bear in mind that the tariffs are due when the product moves into the U.S., which is not always necessarily when you sell it to the customer. And so, that dynamic that you described is just not as clear. And we haven't seen any real clear indications of that pulling forward. I think the bigger question around tariffs, and that's one that I'm really not well equipped to answer, is what ultimately is the effect of these tariffs? Where does it resolve? Does that ultimately have any macro economical effects? Does it have other effects? Those are all things that are probably above my pay grade to think about, or at least to make a forecast about. But I think how we deal with the 10%, how we deal with the 25% of that List 3, it's going to be the same way we've dealt with the tariffs that have come so far. And we've had significant products that have been susceptible to those tariffs. Again, not forgetting about the fact that, by and large, the vast majority of what we make we make and sell in the same region. And that's part of the strategy that we've always taken of being localized to our customers, and so we're not talking about an enormous proportion of our business here; far from that. But there is some that we have to deal with and I think we've dealt with it well so far, and our team will continue to fight like heck to do so regardless of what tariff levels come.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\\nDeepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Two quick questions from me. One is automotive risk. It looks like the organic growth came in a point or two below your expectations. Just curious how much of that was market versus content coming in softer versus expectations? And what's your comfort with continuing your strong high single-digit content growth performance, if the weakness continues well into next year?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I mean, one to two points organic, I guess, it's kind of hard for me to say is that market or content. But as I said earlier, we don't see any signs of content slowing down. I mean, far from it. We continue to see new electronic systems being adopted into cars. So I guess, without knowing exactly what the drivers of the one or two points of organic change, I would say that it's probably the market. And I think I said earlier that we continued to see \\u2013 have a very favorable view, long-term, towards the continued expansion of electronic content in cars around the world. And what the market will be, what the total value \\u2013 or total units of cars is going to be, that's much harder for us to predict. But I think we still feel comfortable that content is going to continue to grow.\\nDeepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. My follow-up is on semiconductor supply chain. Are you seeing any impacts from this well-broadcasted passive shortages, either directly or indirectly? And generally, has that headwind abated? Has that accelerated? I mean, just curious. I mean, it's something that seems to have hit a lot of companies this quarter? Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thank you. No, I think we've talked about that for a couple of quarters and it's a well reported \\u2013 as you correctly point out, it's a very well-reported discussion about, in particular, passives and, I guess, some semiconductors. We have not seen any meaningful impact on the demand of our customers due to these shortages that are so widely reported. I think we're still performing very strongly. On an absolute basis, our growth has probably accelerated over the course of the year, and I think that that's a sign that it hasn't been any real meaningful impact. Have our people spent a little bit more time because there are some of these passives and other assorted components that we once in a while buy for some of our more advanced products? Sure, our sourcing team around the world is working maybe a little bit of overtime to make sure that we don't have any impact on our supply to customers. But the sort of ancillary question of, are customers buying less from us, in general, because they can't get the matching component, while there may be an odd anecdote about that, I can't say that that's had any meaningful impact to the performance.\\nDeepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. If I can sneak just one more in, sorry. Your performance no way indicates that end markets have lost momentum broadly. But my question is what is the sentiment at your customer base that are buying your products? Has that moderated versus 90 days ago? I mean, obviously that's a big deviation from the weak market sentiment we're seeing. I mean just curious what your thoughts are there? And I'll pass it on. Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you. Look I don't think I would say anything different about the sentiment than is reflected in our guidance here for the fourth quarter, which I think continues to be a very strong guidance. I think our customers continue to be very positive, at least, the ones that I have interfaced with and I visit lots of customers on a very frequent basis. I think our customers are continuing to look for us to do the same thing that we've done in many cases, which is to deliver to them enabling technologies that helps them to get their systems to operate at higher levels. We've talked about that with IT, with mobile networks, but the same is true in military where we've done a fantastic job to both produce and design advanced technology products, but also to satisfy a level of demand that probably that industry hasn't seen for quite some time. We talked about that in automotive as well where customers while there's been some slight moderation in the overall demand that demand for new technologies has really not changed, so. And I could go through the markets, all of them, and all reflect on the fact that I think our customers are very positive about the future. Our customers are very thirsty for next-generation technologies. If there are short-term swings in demand that is what it is I think for some of them.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open.\\nJim Suva - Citi: Thanks very much. Adam and Craig, any comments on what you see for inventory levels, whether it be distribution, your customers across the supply chain, because we got to think that giving the tariffs as well as uncertainty and very strong or longer than normal lead-times, one has to wonder about excess inventory or double bookings and will that show itself in a positive manner now and catch up to us? Or simply are your lead-times smaller than say maybe semiconductor companies that have a longer lead-time? Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks very much Jim. I mean, as I've said before, we don't have perfect visibility into the warehouses of our customers. We do see the inventory levels of a good degree of our distribution channel and I think their inventories seem healthy, nothing really notable in our distributors. Look, with all the things that you very astutely pointed out, things like tariffs and the various lead-times and double bookings and all of that, I think a lot of those things are much more related to these passives and semiconductors that Deepa alluded to. Remember that our industry is a different industry and the way we run our company is, once again, a little bit different. It's not a capital-intensive industry and certainly the way that we run Amphenol is not in a capital-intensive fashion. Our ability to react and to adjust to changes in demand, be those on the upside which is a bit more fun, but also on the downside, is really a reflection of that agility that we have from manufacturing perspective. And owing to that agility, we're able to keep our lead-times relatively stable. There are some anecdotes that once in a while where lead-times will go out and I think we've maybe seen a little bit of lead-time stretch in the military market with the extraordinary increase in demand there. But by and large, the way that we operate and the way that the interconnect industry operates is very different from the semiconductor and the passives industry. And thus, I think you see a healthier supply chain behavior with respect to those things that you mentioned, like double booking and other items (59:11).\\nJim Suva - Citi: Thanks so much for the details.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks, Jim.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question in queue comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is now open.\\nTristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering how lean are your operations at this point in the cycle in terms of capacity and utilization rates. And if you have anything you would like to highlight in terms of CapEx spending going forward?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I would just say that we always operate in a very efficient fashion. I think I just \\u2013 when we just talked with Jim about inventory levels, I mentioned that from a capital spending it's not a capital-intensive business. The way that we operate our factories is a fast and flexible fashion. So from that perspective, we're always operating lean. And that's part and parcel to the Amphenol culture. It's not that we try to get ahead of things and build huge capacities and then wait for the orders to come and nor do we when times are good, burst at the seams and can't support our customers. So we try always to scale our operational infrastructure to the demands of the customers regardless of what cycle we're in. And I think when you look over a long time period at the performance of the company, especially during volatile economic times, you'll see that that reflects exactly that principle ultimately in the numbers.\\nCraig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: And the only thing, I guess, I would add on that is as you see this year we have had a little bit higher end of our range from a capital spending perspective. I mean, we have had pretty high levels of growth organically over the first three quarters and certainly guidance for the year here. And in those years while we do have a more significant growth, we certainly do spend a little bit more on capital. But again, it's typically within that kind of 2% to 4% and this year we'll be a little bit higher up into that range. But again, that's just driving those high level of growth that we have right now.\\nTristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then Adam based on your comments about China and tariffs, I guess, you're still likely to do M&A there in China, I think, with the current situation?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think I would answer it even more broadly, which is, we don't do M&A. We don't hunt for potential new family members in Amphenol in a way that is trying to chase the market, a hot market or run away from the market that has maybe lost favor in the electronics industry. We take a very, very long-term view towards acquisitions. Our criteria for acquisitions remains very consistent. I alluded to it earlier. We look for great people. We look for great products or in other words technology and we look for fantastic market position. And sometimes we'll make acquisitions when it's perceived to be the right time and sometimes we'll make acquisitions when it's not perceived to be the right time. And that's all part and parcel of a strategy that says we're buying these companies for the long-term, which is really for a permanent basis. We believe in Amphenol that when we make these acquisitions, we're getting married for life to those companies and to those organizations. And so whether you buy that in one quarter when that's the right place to be or in another quarter where it's not as much of the right place to be that for us is less important. So if the right company comes along, fabulous entrepreneurs, great products, great market position and that happens to be in China or that happens to be in a market space that is not necessarily the hottest space of the moment, we're not going to shy away from that. And along with that I will tell you, regardless, we're always going to be reasonable in terms of our valuation and disciplined in terms of the process of the acquisition. And I think that approach, which is really an approach that is agnostic to short-term variations in market trends and environments is one that has served us very well over the long term. Now, if there are governmental impediments that are put in place, very significant governmental impediments that are put in place, obviously we're not blind to that. And we would be very sensitive to that because any company that we buy, we want to make sure that there are not structural impediments to success. But I don't think we see that in any geography today of any significance.\\nOperator: Thank you. And speakers we show no further questions in queue at this time.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, that's very nice. And again, thank you all very much and we truly appreciate your time today and your interest in the company. And I wish you all a very enjoyable fall season and that we will look forward to seeing you just at the beginning of 2019. Thank you all very much.\\nCraig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day. As a reminder as well, today's call was recorded.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\\nSami Badri: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first quarter fiscal year '24 quarterly conference call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's new Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Having followed Cisco on the sell-side for 10 years, I couldn't be more excited to join the company and look forward to engaging with you all in my new role. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As a reminder, we have simplified how we report product and service revenue and customer markets. Starting this quarter, we are reporting revenue in the following five categories: networking, security, collaboration, observability, and services. And we are reporting customer markets in the following three categories: enterprise, public sector, and service provider and cloud. Also, as is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on forms 10-K which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Sami, and welcome to Cisco. I hope everyone is doing well, and thanks for joining us today. We delivered a solid start to fiscal 2024, with the strongest first quarter results in Cisco's history in terms of revenue and profitability. Our Q1 revenue was at the upper end of our guided range. EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by strength in gross margins and expense control, resulting in strong operating leverage. Our disciplined expense management and the tailwinds from our business model transformation resulted in our highest non-GAAP gross margin in over 17 years and record non-GAAP operating margin. We also returned $2.8 billion in Q1 via cash dividends and share repurchases, delivering on our capital return commitments to our shareholders. As we continue to transform our business towards more software and recurring revenue streams, fueled by accelerated innovation, we remain committed to driving operating leverage and shareholder returns. Now turning to the demand environment, after three quarters of exceptionally strong product delivery, our customers are now focused on installing and implementing these unprecedented levels of products. The bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Our order lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. As deliveries rose, the channel inventory we track at our distributors also steadily declined during this time. Simply put, customers are now taking time to onboard and deploy these heightened product deliveries. While the macro challenges we have discussed still exist, we believe this implementation phase is the primary reason for the slowdown in new orders. We saw it mostly with our larger enterprise, service provider, and cloud customers, and it was most pronounced in October. Based on our analysis, we believe this phase is temporary and estimate there is an additional one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders in customers' hands, still waiting to be deployed. This has near-term consequences for revenue and our outlook for the next couple of quarters, which Scott will discuss shortly. However, it does not change our longer-term confidence. We expect product order growth rates to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. We also remain very confident in the foundational strength of our business and future growth opportunities given the criticality of our technologies. Overall, our win rates are stable, cancellation and return rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, and we have gained market share, all of which are testaments to the strength of our portfolio and how it aligns to our customers' most pressing needs. As we look to enhance our capabilities in higher growth areas, in the first quarter of fiscal '24, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk. The combination of Cisco and Splunk will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency with our complementary capabilities in AI, security, and observability. The combination of Cisco and Splunk also directly supports our strategic objectives around driving higher levels of growth, software capabilities, and ARR. Together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership and outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. Now, let me comment on our quarterly performance. As I previously mentioned, we delivered strong revenues in Q1, which was broad-based across our product portfolio and driven by our customers' investments in generative AI, cloud, security and full stack observability. As expected, we continued to gain market share with the release of the calendar Q2 results, recording another quarter of year-over-year gains in three of our largest networking markets: campus switching, wireless LAN and SP routing. In webscale, we see continued momentum in AI, with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale ethernet AI fabric. We also already have line of sight to over $1 billion in orders for AI infrastructure from major cloud providers in fiscal year '25. To help advance AI, we are working with key GPU and storage partners to create solutions including ethernet technologies, GPU-enabled infrastructure, and joint tested and validated reference architectures with a commitment to open networking for AI. Collectively, we believe there is a great opportunity for a broad set of innovations and compute GPU networking software and services to support core and edge AI infrastructure. According to the 650 Group, the AI switching market is forecasted to exceed $10 billion in 2027. Our scalable fabric for AI, coupled with a proven power saving capabilities of Cisco Silicon One put us in a strong position to build-out the infrastructure needed for AI clusters and we are laser-focused on winning in this space. Moving to Security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap and strengthen our unified security platform. Since our Cisco XDR solution became available this summer, we have added recovery to the response process giving security teams the ability to snapshot and restore their business critical data at the first sign of a ransomware attack. With our three new offers around XDR, Cisco Secure Access and Multicloud Defense, we already have over $500 million in the pipeline across over 1,000 customers. We also launched our new Cisco security firewall solution this quarter. We are actively engaged in competitive sales with all these products and expect to see meaningful positive results in the coming quarters. In our Collaboration portfolio, we recently introduced a range of truly game changing AI capabilities, spanning the entire Webex suite as well as new devices for reimagined workspaces at our WebexOne event. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me briefly summarize three key takeaways. First, as we consider where we're at today, the primary issue with demand is that customers are taking time to onboard and deploy heightened product deliveries. While we were not immune to the macro, we believe this is temporary as our customers and partners continue to tell us that our portfolio is stronger than ever and we have continued to see share gains in key markets. Second, we remain confident in our future, with the incremental multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity, the increasing criticality of security and observability, and what we believe Cisco and Splunk can do together for our customers is truly exciting. Lastly, you can always count on us to take a disciplined approach, regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation, and expense management. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. We delivered solid results in Q1, driven by the prior strategic actions we took to mitigate the supply chain constraints. For the quarter, we reported strong revenue growth and a record non-GAAP operating margin. Total revenue was $14.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year, at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.5 billion, up 28%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.11, up 29%, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 9%; and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, drove the increase with 10% growth. Within networking, the growth was driven by switching, where campus and datacenter were both up double-digits on the strength of our Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000 offerings. This was partially offset by a decline in wireless. Security was up 4%, driven by our Zero Trust and threat intelligence, detection and response offerings. Collaboration was up 3% driven by growth in Calling and Contact Center, partially offset by a decline in Meetings. Observability was up 21%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress in our transformation to more recurring revenue based offerings. We saw solid performance in our ARR of $24.5 billion, which increased 5% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.4 billion, a 13% increase with software subscription revenue also up 13%. 85% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 10% to $6.5 billion, which represents 44% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 1 percentage point over last year. RPO was $34.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product RPO increased 14% and service RPO increased 11%. In total, short-term RPO was up 8% to $17.6 billion. Looking at our product orders by geographic segment, year-over-year, overall product orders declined 20% with the Americas down 19%, EMEA down 13% and APJC down 38%. In our customer markets, Service Provider & Cloud was down 38%, Enterprise was down 26%, and Public Sector was up slightly at 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.1%, up 410 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.5%, up 550 basis points. The increase was driven primarily by productivity improvements, with lower freight, logistics, and component costs. Favorable mix and positive pricing also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Services non-GAAP gross margin was 69%, up slightly. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 36.6%, up 480 basis points and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. This improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing disciplined cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.5 billion. We had operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.4 billion, down 40% primarily due to the $2.8 billion tax payment related to prior quarters, which was associated with the IRS tax relief due to the California floods. This quarter we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases, and growing our dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk, which we expect to close by the end of the third quarter of calendar year 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including approval by Splunk shareholders. In Q1, we also closed several acquisitions, all of which are highly complementary to our internal R&D in line with our strategy to strengthen our position in cloud, security, observability and AI with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter highlighted by topline growth and increased operating leverage that resulted in stronger than anticipated earnings per share. We continue to make progress in our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We remain focused on disciplined expense management without losing sight of the strategic investments necessary to innovate and capitalize on growth opportunities. Turning to our financial guidance, as Chuck outlined, the bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Most of the supply chain constraints are now behind us and both shipment lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. Q1 product orders declined 20% as our largest customers are implementing elevated levels of product shipments from prior quarters as we delivered orders from our historically high backlog levels. As Chuck mentioned, we believe there are one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders awaiting implementation by our customers. Our revenue guidance assumes, one quarter to two quarters of lower revenue and then a return to more typical sequential growth rates. Consequently, for Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82 to $0.84. For fiscal year 2024, our guidance is updated as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.8 billion to $55 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.87 to $3.93. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution this quarter. We remain confident in the strength of the business and our ability to capitalize on the key growth opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it back to Sami, so we can move into the Q&A.\\nSami Badri: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue-up for questions.\\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\\nSami Badri: Tal, you there?\\nTal Liani: Yes. Sorry. I was on mute. Now you can hear me. What is your assumption on the growth seasonality after the next quarter? Are we back in your assumptions to normal seasonality? Or do you expect kind of different seasonality than previous years?\\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Tal, it's a great question. As I said in -- well, we talked about one quarter to two quarters of basically inventory, but shipped product that's at our customers, it's not yet been installed. I expect the impact to be greatest in Q2 and in Q3. But when you look at the order growth, we do see a return to order growth in the second-half of the year, both sequentially and year-on year as we get there.\\nTal Liani: So in terms of revenue recognition, you expect 3Q to -- the 2Q to 3Q sequentials, that's -- that was my question. Do you expect 3Q to be weaker than previous seasonality? Or do you expect it to be the same as previous seasonality? Or even sequentially?\\nChuck Robbins: No, from a revenue standpoint, we don't guide bookings, Tal, but from a revenue standpoint, I do see sequential increase, Q2 to Q3.\\nTal Liani: Okay. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Tal.\\nChuck Robbins: Thank you, Tal.\\nSami Badri: Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead.\\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just a question on, if you see the investment categories kind of changing maybe free, the orders that you've seen, and then when do you see them come back in a couple of quarters. I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of have much of the orders we've seen over the last year been catch-up investments like campus and data center? And then areas of investment will change as we come back or is this really just inventory digestion and the investment categories and kind of investment prioritization will stay the same with customers? Thanks.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Meta, thanks for the question. I think your latter comment is probably the closest to the truth. We don't anticipate a big difference. Although, I think with the improvements that we've seen in our portfolio and security, we should see security accelerate. Obviously, we'll continue to update you on the AI opportunity that's out there. We think that's going to continue to be a driver over the next couple of years. But in general, I think it will look more normal once we get through this.\\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: Thank you, Meta. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Chuck, one of the things I think folks will struggle to understand is the conviction you have that this is an implementation pause and not a macro demand-centric weakness. So I'd love to just understand whatever you can talk about it and why you're so convinced this is a one-quarter to two-quarter implementation rather than enterprise demand is just getting weaker. Anything on that front would be helpful? And then, I just want to clarify the spot. You folks had $1 billion in AI orders that's two times the number you gave last time is that correct? Thank you.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Amit, thank you. So if you'll be patient with me, I'll give you a few data points and some context around why we think this -- this is a -- an inventory issue that's sitting with our customers. First of all, our customers and our sales organizations have been very clear with us over the last 90-days that this is the issue, particularly our large enterprise and our large -- and our service providers. We talked about that with the service providers prior, but it shifted into the enterprise space in a big way. The other thing is, we had our Partner Summit last week and some of our largest partners unsolicited began their conversations with me by talking about this very issue, which candidly I knew the customers had talked about it and our sales teams had talked about it. I was actually surprised to hear. It's so consistently at that Partner Summit. So, that's sort of the subjective view and then we've done some analysis and there's three things I'd point out. The first is, in certain parts of our portfolio, we actually can -- we can see the timeframe from shipment of a product until the product begins to connect to the cloud, back to the cloud like Meraki/And what we've seen is a one-quarter to two-quarter delay versus what historically you would see when these products get shipped, how long it takes for them to be activated and connect to the Meraki cloud. So that's the first piece. The second is, we had a very strong quarter in federal, U.S. federal, from an orders perspective. And so, we looked into why big customer like the U.S. government, Department of Defense, would not have the same issue. And the reality is, is that they have special clauses in their contracts that give them most favored nation status when we're actually making shipment decisions, and certainly with the Department of Defense, we prioritize them during the supply chain crisis. So they never had a big influx, they had a very steady flow of products across, which explains why their order numbers look fairly normal. The third point I'd say is that we noticed a serious uptick in Q1 in our Transactional Advanced Services, which is loosely translated to be implementation services, where that grew almost 20% and the forecast for Q2 is almost double-digits again. So it's clear that customers are asking us to come help them get this done. And I'll give you one final subjective data point and then I'll talk about the AI stuff. We had one big partner tell us that they will have literally hired 200 people in the last 90-days, solely focused on implementing technology for their customers. So there is just so many things that we've learned over the last 90-days. Clearly, this surprised us. But I think we feel pretty good right now. I'll make a comment about why I don't think it's macro, candidly it might have been easier for me to say it was macro. But as we've discussed prior, we have -- the traditional service provider has been tough and it remains that way. We've talked about elongated sales cycle, they remain. We've talked about, in some cases, the need for extra signatures, which is pretty normal, that's remained. But we didn't see it get materially worse in the quarter. And so all of that -- and I'm sorry for the long answer, but I wanted to be thorough, all of that is really what led us to believe this -- that this is a consumption issue with our customers. So I'm going to pause there, and then I'm going to answer your AI question. What we gave last time was orders to-date. We have taken orders for over $500 million. For infrastructure to support AI networks, AI GPUs inside the cloud players. Then -- and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. The numbers that we gave today is a forward-looking set of numbers. Let's say, in fiscal year \\u201825, which is when we said, we believe that the broad ethernet build-out would occur underneath GPUs. We have already seen -- we have line of sight to $1 billion plus of orders that our teams feel pretty good that we're going to get and/or we've been designed in already. So that's just sort of a forward-looking set of orders that we've identified for fiscal \\u201825, okay. I will also just cover real quickly, we are now -- we now have our ethernet fabric deployed underneath GPUs in three of the four Hyperscalers, major Hyperscalers in the United States. We also are working very closely with AMD, Intel and NVIDIA, to create solutions including ethernet technology's GPU-enabled infrastructure joint -- jointly tested and validated reference architectures. And I will say even this week, yesterday, Jensen from NVIDIA and four of his -- four, five of his executives came over to see us and we spent 90 minutes together with my executive team. And we believe we have a great opportunity to actually build some integrated solutions between our technology and their technology to actually take to the enterprise. So we're beginning to see the use cases in the enterprise evolve. And we think that partnership with NVIDIA, in that case, with our underlying technology and our strength of go to market, we think will be a winning combination. So we're working on that as well. So there's a lot going on in the AI space.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Amit. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead.\\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you'd be willing to unpack the networking segment a little bit in terms of the trends. And really what I'm trying to get at is, understand sort of what's doing better, what's doing worse, and in that I suspect it's datacenter bounced us pretty good whereas maybe campus is a bit weaker and declining. And that hopefully during this transition to the new segmentation, if you could give us a little bit more color within networking? Thank you.\\nChuck Robbins: Hey, Simon, thanks for that. I would say the bigger variance that we're seeing, I mean, right now, obviously the demand signal is little bit tough because of the amount of inventory that's out in the field and that we have normalized lead times at this point. We knew that would happen sometime in the first half. That's now happened. Our lead times are back to where they were pre-pandemic. And our backlog has shipped. The supply chain team has done a terrific job getting product out the door. That's what's kind of moved the bottleneck from our level down to our customers' level. But when you start to unpack within networking, we're not seeing at this point, a huge difference between, for example, datacenter or campus networking. But what we are seeing is a little more field-based inventory on wireless access points. That's been slightly slower than what we've seen. It just because of the amount of product that's been shipped out than what we've seen in the rest of the networking.\\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Simon.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Simon.\\nSami Badri: All right. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir.\\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about your share repurchase cadence. Stock obviously could get hit here. We have been talking about $5 billion in buybacks or so for the year. I know some of that stops that dilution. If you guys are confident in the second half pickup, is there any potential that you would be more aggressive in the upcoming quarter? And how are you thinking about share repo this year, given current dynamics with the Splunk deal coming? Thanks.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Ben, as we said on the Splunk transaction, it's going to be outside of the transactional costs. It's going to be cash flow positive from the first year forward. So the Splunk transaction is not, in any way, having an effect on our capital return, either through the dividend or through the -- through share buybacks. We expect to continue that higher level and consistent higher level of share buybacks, and to continue to show increases in our dividend. We also will obviously look at the opportunity -- at the chance to be opportunistic on the share buyback. I'm not going to commit to that at this moment, but that is something that we will obviously take a look at.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Ben.\\nBen Reitzes: Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, if I can just clarify one thing first. I think, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you did say, you saw the more pronounced impact on the orders in the month of October. I think that's what I heard you say. I mean, just curious, are you implying that you did see an improvement in orders in the sort of first couple of weeks of November itself and that's maybe part of your confidence in that? It's a bit more temporary than a longer pause from the customers? And then you did mention large partners really being the ones that are facing this sort of inventory installation problem. What gives you sort of color that SMB, the smaller customers sort of not going to face the similar issue or are you also baking that in, in terms of your sort of next couple of quarters of headwinds that you're thinking about on the revenue side? Thank you.\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Samik. I think my point with October was that if you go back to the end of Q4, we talked about on the last call that we had a fair amount of momentum as we exited the quarter, which is one of the reasons we didn't expect to see this. And we had our normal year-end sales, moving accounts around, moving territories around, and getting sort of the sales start-up process that happens in the first say six weeks of the fiscal year, which we went through. So what we tend to look for is the middle of the quarter. And then into October is when we expect to see, the actual quarter materialize and everything kind of come together, and it just didn't. And that's what -- that was the comment about that it was primarily -- we really -- it was really clear to us in October that -- that this was going to be the situation. Relative to they\\u2019re the ones who are having the consumption issue because they have the most inventory. You asked how we -- what confidence we have if it's not SMB, if you look at orders, we look at -- we look at a sub-segmentation within enterprise now, and within service provider, etc., and SMB was fine. And in fact, the smaller the customer we had, the better their order performance for us in the quarter was. So it just follow the trend that the consumption issue was upmarket and small to mid-sized customers didn't feel it.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Samik. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Scott, maybe this is for you. I just want to unpack maybe one of the comments that you made. And I know you don't guide to orders. But I think in your prepared remarks, you said backlog is back at normal levels at the end of the quarter. So, we do assume that the guide for Q2 and the rest of the year doesn't include backlog conversion into revenue? And then, if that's the case, to your comment about orders accelerating in the second half, I know you don't guide specifically to orders, but you did make a comment that revenue is going be up, I think, sequentially in the third quarter year-over-year and in the fourth quarter sequentially and year-over-year. Doesn't that suggest like a pretty steep order acceleration, not just an acceleration, but significant positive order trajectory in the fourth quarter and the third quarter? I know, it's easy comps. But just some more color there would be helpful. Thanks.\\nScott Herren: Yes. Yes, David, we did say that. I do. We are expecting sequential improvement in the second half of the year in both Q3 and in Q4. And in both -- and again, we don't guide this, but in both orders and revenue as you'd expect. Backlog is normalized at this point. We knew that would happen in the first half. I think supply chain team did a great job getting those orders in the hands of our customers. We would now need them to implement them, but we've got the orders in the hands of our customers. So we do see sequential increases. And as you said, as you noted from a bookings standpoint, our order standpoint, the second half has easier compare points. Obviously, the reverse is true on revenue and the second half revenue will have very difficult compare points than last year.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, David. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys, thank you for taking the question. Maybe just to dovetail one follow-up to the prior question, I have just another one on margins. Just on the prior one, is the expectation for a second-half improvement in a one-quarter to two-quarter digestion, does that vary at all across the three different customer sets you outlined? And then just on the margins, 36.6% on op income margins this quarter, I think the guide implies a 400 basis point to 500 basis point dip. Is that due to just the sheer revenue decline sequentially? Or are there other cost items we should consider on either the gross margin or OI margin line? Thanks.\\nScott Herren: Yes. To your second question, it is just based on how the revenues are flowing through the second half of the year. I think gross margins, we've said will settle in somewhere in this 65% to 66% range. I think at this point, it looks like it will be closer to the higher end of that range for the second part of the year. So that's the way I see the year flowing out. Remind me, Matt, what was the first part of your question.\\nMatt Niknam: Just around the expectation for second-half improvement in orders one quarter to two quarters worth of installation, is that broad across the three customer sets? Or does it vary across service provider, enterprise and federal?\\nScott Herren: Yes, right. I think, we expect -- I certainly would expect service provider to continue to be difficult through the second-half of the year. Within service provider, we've got both telco and cable, which has one set of market dynamics going on. I think that will be -- continue to be a difficult space. On the other side, we have web scale, and we do see the web scale orders while they've got also inventory to work their way through. We do see line of sight to them beginning to increase their orders again in the second half of the year. So, SP is a bit of a mixed bag, but I think it will continue to have probably the greater impact.\\nMatt Niknam: Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Matt. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\\nGeorge Notter: Hi. Thanks a lot, guys. Just continuing on, on that last question. If I look around the space, companies have been dealing with excess inventories for really three quarters now. And I guess, I'm just curious why is this now becoming more evident at Cisco versus a few quarters ago? And then also you mentioned that the issue is spreading more to enterprises. We don't typically think about enterprises is inventorying infrastructure. So I guess, the question for you is, has something changed there or is this more distribution channel inventory? Any insight would be great. Thanks.\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, George. I think that the reason it's become relevant now is because if -- I mean, we really unloaded our backlog in the last six months. I mean -- and it was billions of dollars more than what we would normally ship to customers during that time period. So they -- I think it's just -- and we know that the cloud providers, as an example, had been buying ahead and they had been doing it for sure to your point. And all along, we have very sequenced purchasing cycles with those players. So we kind of know when they are going to start placing their next orders. I think on the enterprise, we're talking about the top 200 customers, right. These are the big customers who actually -- if they're doing a refresh of their infrastructure, they might order 400, 500 switches, as an example. Or they may be doing a branch rollout. And in some cases, to your point, it could be sitting with them or they could have a partner who's doing the staging, and the partner may be backed up with resources to try to get the staging done. So it varies, but it could be a -- either one of those or a combination of both.\\nScott Herren: And George, just to put some data to that. And you have this data, but I'll repeat it. Our revenue growth, obviously, the quarter we're announcing now, product revenue growth was 9%. But if you go back to Q4, product revenue growth was 20%. And in Q3, it was 17%. So obviously, we get revenue when we can complete a shipment and get it out the door. It gives you a sense of just how much has been pushed out and as Chuck said in the last two or three quarters.\\nGeorge Notter: Alright. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: Thank you, George. And then Michelle, we have time for one last question.\\nOperator: Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, on the AI orders, $1 billion. What's the feedback from the hyperscalers on your improving position with these customers relative to a few years ago? Is it selling in a more disaggregated fashion with Silicon One? Is it a desire for silicon diversification? And then the second question just as a follow-up on the order slowdown. Was that more concentrated in the campus with wireless LAN and wired or data center or both, just within enterprise specifically?\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Michael. On the AI question relative to the cloud players, I think that -- look, I think early on, we regained our footing there because we listened and we showed flexibility with our willingness to disaggregate if they wanted to do so. And we're in -- I can't even remember, but numerous use cases across the large web scale players. And I think we added over 10 new use cases last quarter alone, where we had been designed in. And I think it's -- so I think that the disaggregation and the flexibility and us listening to them and understanding what they wanted was the reason that we got back in. And now the feedback is as long as we're performing, I think they like our products, they like the power savings of Silicon One. It's a massive power -- lower -- massively lower power consumption. I think they do like silicon diversity for sure. And then as you look at the AI infrastructure that's currently primarily being supported via InfiniBand, they just want to move to more of a standard broad-based technology like Ethernet that they can actually have multiple sources. And so we think that's what's driving that now. And now it's just about performing and executing and delivering on what we tell them we're going to do. Scott, do you want to take the second?\\nScott Herren: Yes. Michael, I think I touched on this earlier in the -- as the question came up. I think the way to think about it is, first of all, if you're trying to generalize the trend more broadly across the industry, it may be a little difficult because we've cleared our backlog, I think, significantly faster than others have. But where we saw a differentiation was less between big data center infrastructure and campus networking and more between networking and wireless. We did see -- because we've shipped an enormous amount of wireless access points out. We did see that take a little bit more of an impact just because it's -- our customers are sitting on more inventory on hand of that, that they're looking to get installed.\\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, Scott.\\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Michael, and all right. So we'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck, for some closing remarks.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thank you, Sami, and welcome again. Listen, we're proud of the team for the performance in Q1. Obviously, a very solid quarter with the exception of this demand issue that we talked about. We'll always try to be transparent with you and share with you exactly what we're seeing. We know what's going on. We're on top of it, and we do feel that it's temporary. At the same time, we're very confident in our opportunities long term. We're confident in the AI opportunity. We're very encouraged by our improving position in security, observability. And we're also very encouraged by the opportunities that will come with the Splunk acquisition. I think many of you know that on Monday night, the waiting period for review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. expired, meaning that we've effectively pass the antitrust review period in the United States. We're excited about that. At our Partner Summit last night -- or last week, the feedback on our portfolio right now was probably as good as it's been in a long time. And I also just want to reiterate our commitment to delivering value to you and our shareholders with the operating leverage, capital allocation and obviously managing our expenses in times when we see challenges like we have right now. So thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it back over to Sami.\\nSami Badri: Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 second quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 14, 2024 and at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.\\nOperator: And thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 1 (800) 834-5839. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial (203) 369-3351. This concludes today's call.

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the call over to David Gennarelli, senior director of investor relations. Please go ahead, sir.\\nDavid Gennarelli: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our third quarter. Also on the line is Carl Bass, our chief executive officer, and Scott Herren, our CFO. Today\\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2015; long-term financial model guidance, including billings, subscriptions, and recurring revenue growth; the factors we use to estimate our guidance; new business model introductions; new product and suite releases; market adoption and expected growth rates; business execution; business prospects and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies including our desktop subscription offerings plan; our transition to cloud and mobile computing; trends and sales initiatives for our products; and trends in various geographies and industries. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment, based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2014, our Form 10-Q for the periods ended April 30 and July 31, 2014, and current reports on Form 8-K, including the form 8-K filed with today\\u2019s press release and prepared remarks.  Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information.  Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today\\u2019s call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today\\u2019s press release, prepared remarks, and on the Investor Relations section of our website.  We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Carl.\\nCarl Bass: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Much like last quarter, our third quarter results reflect strength across industries, geographies, and products. We continue to make meaningful progress in our business model transition to a more recurring subscription based business, adding approximately 121,000 subscriptions, which includes 25,000 Delcam subscriptions that were not previously captured. As a result, the third revenue increased significantly to a record $1 billion, a milestone for Autodesk. All three of our major geographies, as well as emerging economies, grew double digits on a constant currency basis, led by growth in EMEA. Similar to last quarter, the areas in which we\\u2019re seeing weakness are those affected by geopolitical turmoil.  We also experienced strength in transactions greater than $1 million. These large deals were spread across all the major geographies, and fairly even spread between [AEC] and manufacturing. While the number of these large transactions increased nearly 60%, the total value of these large transactions increased over 200%. Our investments in enterprise sales and consulting services have directly led to the increase in large deals and the size of these transactions. Many of these large deals were flexible enterprise licensing agreements. In addition to being a great benefit for our customers, these token-based contracts create a larger recurring revenue stream, which is recognized ratably. These agreements are also contributing to our subscription growth as we\\u2019re experiencing increased use of our cloud services. Third quarter license revenue would have been approximately $26 million higher before the impact of flexible enterprise license agreements.  The environments for global construction, coupled with the continued customer excitement for our desktop and cloud-based BIM tools resulted in a strong Q3 for our AEC business. Anchored by [unintelligible], our BIM portfolio continues to resonate with customers across segments, but especially in construction.  We closed several large deals with construction companies that include BIM 360, which continues to be one of Autodesk\\u2019s fastest growing products ever. The AEC suites grew 23%. The large AEC deals that we closed during the quarter were across all geographies, including deals with four of the top 25 E&R design firms. Our manufacturing team delivered strong growth of 20% in Q3. Growth was driven by wins in large verticals including industrial machinery, consumer products, and automotive. Strength in our core product design suite is leading the growth, but we are really encouraged by what we are seeing with our cloud-based products. We are particularly pleased with the customer response to Fusion 360. It is the next generation cloud-based CAD system for mechanical engineers and industrial designers. We put Fusion 360 on the Mac App Store last quarter, and within a few days, there were over 100,000 downloads. Not only are small customers using it, but we\\u2019re increasingly seeing large customers adopt it, often replacing their traditional desktop tools. With PLM 360, we added many new customers, and perhaps even more encouraging is that we continue to see customers returning to purchase additional seats.  Three of our top five PLM 360 deals were based in EMEA, where we are showing a lot of progress. We also closed our largest-ever manufacturing deal in Q3. This was an eight-figure transaction covering design, simulation, data management, and consulting. It was also our biggest PLM 360 win to date.  The customer is a Fortune 500 industrial and technology company. It\\u2019s a story we\\u2019ve heard for years. They\\u2019ve been struggling with their legacy PLM system and began looking for a cost-effective, scalable alternative that would integrate easily with their other business systems. Rather than spending millions more dollars on their old PLM system, they\\u2019re using PLM 360. We believe this is only the beginning of the cloud-based PLM revolution. It is easier to deploy, easier to configure, and a lot less expensive than legacy PLM systems.  This quarter, we announced our plans to introduce cloud-based data management to complement the existing cloud-based PLM. Our business model transition is gaining momentum. We\\u2019ve added 285,000 subscriptions through the first three quarters of thank you. This has been a fantastic start that is well ahead of our initial expectations. The discontinuation of the upgrade program at the end of this fiscal year is helping drive our [maintenance] subscriber count. It\\u2019s not surprising that we\\u2019ve seen a lot of customers take advantage of the upgrade program, and we are experiencing a higher maintenance subscription attach rate with these upgrades. What we\\u2019re really encouraged about is the contribution we\\u2019re getting from desktop and cloud subscriptions. AutoCAD LT has quickly become our leading desktop subscription offering. As we mentioned at our investor day event last month, a meaningful portion of our desktop subscription customers are new to Autodesk, and about half are subscribing by purchasing through our e-store. Those are great early trends. Cloud subscriber growth remains very high and similar to desktop subscription. It\\u2019s bringing a significant number of new users to Autodesk. Our cloud-based project collaboration tool, A360, is still in limited release, and we\\u2019re very encouraged by some of the early indicators for that product. Our mobile and cloud-based products are being adopted by our customers, which validates the investments and focus we\\u2019ve put into these products. Autodesk has moved quickly to establish a leadership position in cloud and mobile and in many ways, we\\u2019re just getting started.  The early success we\\u2019ve experienced with our business model transition has in part led us to accelerate the process. As we outlined last month, we plan to stop selling new perpetual offerings over the next 12 to 24 months. Stay tuned for more details around this over the coming months, as we start to discuss specifics with our customers and channel partners regarding these plans. Given our strong Q3 performance, we\\u2019ve raised our FY15 guidance ranges for billings revenue and subscriptions. The advancements we\\u2019ve been making in cloud and mobile are just beginning to show up in these metrics.  Earlier this year, I called out that operating margin is muted for a number of reasons, including the impact from the business model transition, investments we\\u2019re making in our cloud infrastructure, the dilutive effect of the Delcam acquisition, as well as incremental investment spending on key initiatives. Additionally, commissions and our employee incentive program are volume-related and increased based on our better-than-expected billings performance. Lastly, I\\u2019m very pleased that earlier this month, Scott Herren joined Autodesk as our CFO and is joining me on this call. Scott brings with him a broad mix of financial sales and product management experience. His leadership experience at Citrix will benefit Autodesk in our model transition over the coming years. I\\u2019d like to thank Sue Pirri, who did a great job leading our finance organization during the interim, as well as the rest of the finance team. So to wrap things up, we were really pleased with our overall results in Q3. The year has shaped up to be stronger than our initial view, and we remain confident in our long term business model transition goals of 12% billing CAGR, 20% more customer value, 50% more subscriptions, and 30% operating margins. As you know, a key element of our model transition is ending perpetual offerings over the next 12 to 24 months. While we are not providing FY16 guidance at this time, keep in mind that doing so will impact the top line profitability in the short term. As always, we will monitor global economic conditions as well as currency movements as we head toward FY16. We look forward to building onto early successes and transitioning Autodesk to a more profitable and recurring subscription-based model over the coming years. Operator, we\\u2019d now like to open the call up for questions. \\nOperator: [Operator instructions.] The first question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.\\nBrent Thill: Carl, the last couple of quarters on the billings you\\u2019ve obviously done really well, mid-20% growth, yet the fiscal guide at 15% to 17% would just imply a stronger falloff in the next quarter. What\\u2019s your sense in terms of is that just a conservative view on your behalf for the fourth quarter? And I\\u2019m just curious if that eight-figure deal, how that is going to be recognized.\\nCarl Bass: Yes, the eight-figure deal is a ratable deal, and so it will be taken over a longer period of time. The one thing we said about the changing model during this year is that promotional incentives got weaker towards the end of the year. So while we\\u2019ve exceeded it for all the quarters so far, we\\u2019re always a little bit cautious, because the incentives to do so go down. As we get to the fourth quarter, the incentive is eliminated, except for the fact that it\\u2019s expiring. So there\\u2019s less financial incentive, there\\u2019s greater time-based pressure. Trying to wrap those two together, that\\u2019s where we ended up as our guidance.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\\nKeith Weiss: It looks like really strong progress in the business model transition. I was wondering if we could kind of sort of cut off at the head what\\u2019s going to be probably the biggest bear case out there of how do we know that we\\u2019re not pulling forward potential demand out of FY16 with this strength this year? How do you guys get comfortable with that you\\u2019re going to be sort of able to sustain the pace of maybe like billings growth, if you will, as we go through further into this business model transition?\\nCarl Bass : The first one, for me, Keith, is getting more people on maintenance subscription is not a pull-through. And so I\\u2019ve actually had a little bit of a hard time just reckoning about that, because we have customers who were not on maintenance who are now on maintenance. It\\u2019s a big thing. Any way I look at it, I think that\\u2019s the best possible outcome for us, to get a nonsubscriber on subscription. We\\u2019ve also talked about, as we\\u2019re moving forward, that while this is a promotion for this year, we\\u2019ve talked a lot about what we\\u2019re going to do next year in terms of ending perpetual licenses. In many ways, that\\u2019s probably a bigger incentive for our customers to do something differently. And I don\\u2019t know if I can help you take the bear and put it up on the wall, mount it, and stuff it, but I think some of the arguments out there are trying to extrapolate from too few facts, or to take this one thing and say, you know, this is the only incentive program that will work with our customers. And I don\\u2019t really think that\\u2019s true.\\nKeith Weiss : If I could potentially sneak one last one in, just in terms of the mix of the subscriptions that we are seeing, is it remaining relatively constant with the strong heavily weighting towards the maintenance subscriptions, or are you starting to see a richer mix of desktop subscriptions in there?\\nCarl Bass : It\\u2019s richer, but it\\u2019s still heavily, heavily subscription, because that\\u2019s the one being promoted. And the others are off small bases, so we like the trajectory of the other ones, but in terms of meaningful financial contribution, it\\u2019s maintenance. And while we\\u2019ve said it may slow down going into the fourth quarter, I think the proportion will remain somewhat constant. \\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.\\nWalter Pritchard:   Just a question as it relates to the token related deals. It sounded like in the first couple of quarters of the year you didn\\u2019t have as much business go that way. In the third quarter, you had about $26 million that was a headwind, and then it sounds like last year you had some impact, and I\\u2019m wondering if you can help us understand how you expect that business to ramp in the fourth quarter, and then do we expect to see a more significant uptick in that revenue stream as you go into fiscal 2016?\\nCarl Bass : Why don\\u2019t we start at the back end of that question? I think we\\u2019ve demonstrated over the last few years that this investment in enterprise sales and consulting services has really paid off. We tried to demonstrate it a little bit at investor day, where we showed you not only our customers paying more, they\\u2019re using more. This has been truly a win-win situation.  We\\u2019re going to continue to invest in it and even to our channel partners, the thing I say all the time is when we win these big enterprise accounts, it\\u2019s good for the whole ecosystem. So this is not at the expense of our channel partners. Quite the contrary. It is reinforcing business for our channel partners. So we\\u2019re going to continue to invest in it. We think we\\u2019ve barely tapped into it. We outlined that we\\u2019ve had kind of in the dozens of accounts that we\\u2019re talking to with this. And there\\u2019s probably upwards of 1,000 customers who will eventually move this way. And we\\u2019re going to keep doing it. Now, one of the things also about it, just to the timing that you talked about, we have always had a lot of these deals in Q4. Last year we made a conscious effort to move some of them into Q3. For a number of reasons, we like to spread it more fully throughout the year, but it is not fully within our control. And so I suspect it will always be a little bit back end loaded throughout the year, but just in general, the two takeaways are we\\u2019re going to continue to invest, because we think it\\u2019s really good business, and the second thing is this level of flexibility with products is something we hope to offer to a broader range of our customers, not just the top thousand accounts.\\nWalter Pritchard : And then just a question for Scott. Welcome aboard. It may be too early to ask you this quarter, and you don\\u2019t have all the history, but I look at your rates of revenue guide for the year and the operating margin guide for the year is sort of the lower half of where you were talking before, and you mentioned that you have more commissions being paid out, and we\\u2019ve seen this over time with Autodesk where if the performance is good, it impinges on the margins in the near term. Can you talk about how much of what\\u2019s going on on the incremental expense side here in the guide now has to do with that versus investments that you have to make more for the longer term?\\nScott Herren: It\\u2019s both. We are investing in cloud infrastructure, buildout for the business model. We\\u2019re investing in the back office system so that we can handle the higher volume of transactions. Delcam is in there, which is hitting the op margin year on year, and I think the one unique thing that we see in Q4 is some of the volume related things that hit Q4 around both commissions and variable comp for the year. So I don\\u2019t think it makes sense to break that out, but I think the way you need to think about it is it\\u2019s a combination of both. The volume-related things in Q4, and some of those trends, the investment in the business model transition, frankly, will continue in the next year. \\nOperator: The next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.\\nBrendan Barnicle: Scott, just following up on Walter\\u2019s question, can we assume that margins have bottomed here, or given the model transition, particularly at the end of perpetual coming sometime over the next 12 to 24 months, should we expect that maybe margins go lower still? \\nScott Herren : We\\u2019re not giving guidance right now for fiscal 2016 and beyond, as you can appreciate. We\\u2019re in the midst of our fiscal 2016 planning right now. So I\\u2019m not at liberty at this point to talk about some of the longer term trends.\\nBrendan Barnicle : Well, as I think about how we think about modeling licenses, and those perpetuals essentially going away, is there a point next year that we may have a quarter where that license line just is at zero, and so we should be kind of preparing the models for that? \\nScott Herren : I\\u2019ll start, and then I\\u2019ll hand back off to Carl on this. Whether it\\u2019s next year or beyond, I think what we\\u2019ve said is we\\u2019re planning to end of life perpetual license in the next 12 to 24 months, and that of course is a big driver of that license line.\\nCarl Bass : Yeah, and the only thing I\\u2019d add, you know, I tried to give you guys a little bit more color when a number of you were here during investor day. One of the variables that we have the knobs and dials around this are whether we do all products at the same time or stagger it, and whether we do all geographies at the same time or not. So we do have some level of control over those things. What we were more indicating is directionally, by the end of the 24 months.  I think in some ways it would just be unusual operationally to drive to a place where we get to zero license revenue in a quarter, but directionally, I think you clearly understand where we\\u2019re headed.\\nBrendan Barnicle : As you have more of these eight-figure deals, like that large one that you mentioned that you\\u2019ll be recognizing over time, does it make sense at some point to share an off balance sheet bookings type number? \\nCarl Bass : Welcome, Scott. [laughter]\\nScott Herren : Yeah, thanks for that. You know, Brendan, I think it\\u2019s fairly straightforward. I know it\\u2019s a calculation that gets done today, and I think it\\u2019s not that difficult to pull it right out of the change in deferred revenue plus the announced revenues. So I don\\u2019t know that it\\u2019s that difficult a metric. It is something that we\\u2019ll talk about if it makes sense, besides guiding to a growth rate, just to start to guide to an absolute number and then report on that.\\nBrendan Barnicle : Scott, I was referencing those deals where you don\\u2019t bill all in advance, so we don\\u2019t see it on the deferred revenue, and you have some that\\u2019s off balance sheet.\\nScott Herren : Oh, I\\u2019m sorry, you\\u2019re talking about the enterprise agreements specifically?\\nBrendan Barnicle : Right. As you do more of those and they become more material, is that going to be a metric we should start to look at, like we do for Salesforce or Microsoft\\u2019s contract on build? \\nScott Herren : I don\\u2019t actually have a plan. I would say it feels to me it\\u2019s a bit awkward to announce that, because all of the revenues there, all those enterprise agreements, are captured, or most of them are captured in the deferred revenue balance. So it feels a bit awkward that we split it out today, but I don\\u2019t have a plan to either continue to be more explicit on that or not.\\nCarl Bass : If it turns out that somehow it\\u2019s so opaque that you\\u2019re having trouble understanding it, then we\\u2019ll provide some clues to how to do that. I hope it becomes a problem. [laughs]\\nOperator: The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\\nHeather Bellini: Carl, at the investor day last month, you mentioned that in fiscal 2016, you thought that you could add at least as many subs in that period as you add in fiscal 2015. And I guess I\\u2019m just wondering, would you still say that\\u2019s possible given your significant outperformance and your new sub-guidance for this year? And then I just had a follow up.\\nCarl Bass : I know what you\\u2019re trying to do. You\\u2019re trying to trick me into giving guidance for next year. [laughter]\\nHeather Bellini: [laughs] We would not do that. \\nCarl Bass : I know that. You know what, I feel really good about the trajectory of the subs. I\\u2019d be a little hesitant to start guiding for subs for next year, but right now all I would say is all the curves on the subs look really good, and three months from now, in February, we\\u2019ll start trying to break it out. There\\u2019s nothing here that I see going in the wrong direction, but we\\u2019ll just wait the three months.\\nHeather Bellini : Okay, and then the follow up question was, I know you all have been working on some initiatives to help drive renewal rates higher, and I\\u2019m just wondering if you could share with us, are you seeing some of those initiatives start to pay off, and as a result, how have your renewal rates been trending? Because I know that\\u2019s big for Q4.\\nCarl Bass : Yeah, so the renewal rates are definitely being driven higher. Some is being driven programmatically, like we talked about with the end of upgrades, and some it\\u2019s just more attention to detail, if you will, about the nonrenewals. And so we\\u2019ve done a better job, we\\u2019ve put more systems in place, to track that. We\\u2019ve been [unintelligible] our partners and ourselves to do it. It\\u2019s edging up on small numbers, because [we\\u2019re at] a relatively high number, but it\\u2019s still a good direction and material.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.\\nGregg Moskowitz: First question is for Carl. Just wondering if you saw any changes in the quarter with regard to the mix of new versus existing subscribers across both desktop as well as cloud?\\nCarl Bass : No, a lot of the trends we outlined in October are kind of continuing. And I think they\\u2019ll be relatively stable, but we\\u2019ll update them and if we see a material change we\\u2019ll talk about it. But we\\u2019re learning as we go too.\\nGregg Moskowitz : Scott, wanted to ask where we are right now when it comes to the investments that you alluded to in back office systems and cloud infrastructure. When we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, how much of this lies ahead versus kind of what you guys have done already?\\nScott Herren : It\\u2019s day 14 for me today, so what I\\u2019d say on that front is obviously those investments didn\\u2019t start just this quarter, they\\u2019ve been in flight. But I think it\\u2019s a significant transition, both in building out the cloud infrastructure for the world that we envision around desktop subscriptions as well as building out the back office systems to handle the significantly higher volume of transactions. So it\\u2019s still early innings on those investments. \\nOperator: The next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays.\\nSaket Kalia: First, I realize it\\u2019s still early to provide guidance for fiscal 2016, but just given the moves that we\\u2019ve had in the euro and yen, can you just talk about how FX exposure might look next year compared to what you\\u2019ve hedged?\\nCarl Bass: As we\\u2019ve talked about, we always have the rolling hedge. We continue to have that. But FX will definitely be a headwind next year. [Or maybe it] moves the other way. If it just stayed where it is today, it\\u2019s definitely a headwind, and it gets more significant as we go out to the end of next year versus Q1 of next year.\\nScott Herren : Yeah, if you look at our hedge program, it is layered out in time, and so obviously as the year goes on, the exposure from today goes up. But I\\u2019d say you can look at our revenue mix, you can see where we are. Obviously the euro is a significant currency for us. The yen\\u2019s a significant currency for us. And it\\u2019s something that we\\u2019ll take into account when we do provide guidance for fiscal 2016.\\nSaket Kalia : And then Carl, I think you said last quarter that the third quarter was a little bit slower in terms of subscribers coming from maintenance renewals compared to the fourth quarter. Is that still the case?\\nCarl Bass : If I said that, maybe I misspoke. I thought it was the other way. Generally speaking, what I thought is you\\u2019d see, in Q3, more subscribers in the small, medium part of our business. And what we would see is more enterprise agreements in Q4. And you know, that was really our best guestimate, as I said, on those two factors of the time-based nature of expiring, yet the financial incentives were going to zero.\\nOperator:  The next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.\\nSterling Auty:  On the enterprise flexible licensing agreements that you\\u2019ve got, can you give us a sense, what\\u2019s the average duration on those types of deals? So in other words, when would we expect the deals that you did this quarter to start coming back up for renewal?\\nCarl Bass : I\\u2019m not sure if I can give you the average, but typical is a three-year agreement. So that\\u2019s a very typical agreement, is a three year.\\nScott Herren : And I think, Sterling, bear in mind these deals are largely ratable in terms of revenue. So they\\u2019ll drive a bit of lumpiness in the billing stream. It will be a little bit smoother on the revenue stream.\\nSterling Auty: And then can you give us a sense of the linearity of the subscribers that you added through the quarter? Was it fairly linear, or did you see any particular patterns through the quarter? \\nCarl Bass : If you take out the Delcam one, which is a one-time thing, but if you look at kind of the organic, it tracks pretty closely to the way you would have seen the seasonality around revenue historically. So a little bit heavier in the last month of the quarter, but not tremendously so. \\nSterling Auty : And then last question, I know you\\u2019re not giving us when in the 12 to 24 months you\\u2019re going to eliminate the perpetual licensing, but can you give us some of the factors that are kind of going into your decision process?\\nCarl Bass : Yeah, we\\u2019re looking at a number of things. We are working the program with our customers. We\\u2019ve engaged them and are talking heavily with them. We\\u2019re working with our partners. I mean, what we intended to do, as opposed to the kind of rip off the band aid strategy, was we were going to work through this slowly and deliberately. And we\\u2019re making sure we keep the business as intact as possible as we move through what\\u2019s a fairly big transition. \\nOperator: The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Carl, I\\u2019d like to ask first about the famous 2.9 million active base number from the analyst meeting. That is, customers who\\u2019ve purchased product but haven\\u2019t gone on maintenance. By our math, the largest piece of that, of the three main buckets, is customers who upgraded since fiscal 2010 through this year but didn\\u2019t for some reason take maintenance as well. Could you talk about why those customers would not have taken maintenance in spite of all the promotions and inducements you\\u2019ve had over the years for them to do so when they upgraded, and how do you now get them to convert? Then a follow up.\\nCarl Bass : When you go to Best Buy, do you buy that service contract, Jay? You know, I think there are a lot of things that we do. I mean, if they ask me one more time at checkout if I want that service contract I\\u2019m going to shoot them. [laughter] I think it\\u2019s the same thing. Remember, we\\u2019ve talked about this as we\\u2019ve reintroduced these programs, many of our customers have been buying for decades. They have a certain buying behavior. We\\u2019ve talked about, depending on the product, they may feel like the maintenance subscription is more or less valuable.  So the two biggest factors we see are the lower cost products generally have lower attach and renewal rates. And the other one is geographically, there\\u2019s wide variance between, generally speaking, developed countries and emerging economies. So those are the two biggest differences. You know, as we move forward, we hope to eliminate that choice by the combination of this year\\u2019s program and next year\\u2019s program, or over the next two-year program. We\\u2019re going to get to a place where customers are on a program with us.\\nJay Vleeschhouwer : The follow up is at the analyst meeting, you mentioned value per account as an important metric. That\\u2019s come up in some conversations since then. Would a corollary to that be that at some point, Autodesk would introduce a single \\u201cAutodesk account\\u201d as a kind of uber suite for access and particularly for driving the flex licensing downmarket into SMB? Would that be some way that you could approach combining flex licenses with making it more broadly available or appealing to the smaller accounts?\\nCarl Bass : Yes, let me break this into two questions, which somehow you managed to put it into one. And I\\u2019m still looking for the connection. But let me just separate it. It helps my feeble mind process it.  On the ARPU conversation, we talked about value per account. Some people have asked us about ARPU. What we\\u2019ve said about ARPU, because of the \\u201cA\\u201d in there, it\\u2019s going to be really mix sensitive, and we have a wide range that\\u2019s going into that.  And we do think the distribution of it will be more helpful, or some categorization or bucketing of it is better. And I think if you do it by account, it\\u2019s a way of normalizing that is not nearly as mix sensitive. So that\\u2019s what we\\u2019ve thought about there.  Second question in my mind is about what I said is we\\u2019ve seen tremendous reception from the enterprise licenses. Customers truly appreciate the flexibility and the access to pieces of software they might not have had. We think many of our small and medium business customers will want the same thing.  You mentioned the uber suite. I think we will introduce something that is similar to giving people access to the portfolio for a fixed price. We\\u2019re not going to announce anything today, but it\\u2019s certainly directionally where we\\u2019re headed. Again, we think this is a win for everyone involved, at least while we\\u2019ve been able to manage more closely in the enterprise space. We will first broaden it there, and then secondarily, introduce it to the more general population. \\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird.\\nSteve Ashley: I\\u2019d just like to go back to the success you\\u2019re having with the large deals and just maybe try to get some more color on how you\\u2019re driving that. I think you mentioned that some of it is your consulting services, but if you could just maybe walk us through how you are having success in driving those here with this go-to-market, that would be great. \\nCarl Bass : Yeah, you know, the unsaid thing that I scratch my head too is kind of if you\\u2019re having such great success with it now, what took you so long? And one thing that we have seen very clearly is the buildout of capabilities of our consulting services have mattered a lot. So it\\u2019s one thing to provide access to people, but if you really want to drive usage and adoption, we need people onsite to do that, particularly in large, complex organizations. So it\\u2019s large, complex organizations that already have complicated business processes in hand, or ones like, for example, in some of the engineering construction firms, where they\\u2019re going through a transformation and adopting BIM, and they need help understanding how to best bring that into their business. And the differences in places where we have consulting versus we don\\u2019t are dramatic in terms of their adoption and in terms of the increasing value of those contracts when they get renewed. The second thing is, I think this is just one of these things, as we began to have a bigger major account presence and listen to our customers, we realized that that was happening simultaneously with the buildout of a much bigger and broader product portfolio. So if you were to roll this back five years, part of the thing was we just didn\\u2019t have as rich a set of offerings to go in with.  We now have a much richer set of offerings, and that\\u2019s true both in our AEC, [our M&E] and our manufacturing products, and we have the people who can deliver what\\u2019s really needed for the customer to be successful.  Probably the third factor is slightly more environmental, in which there\\u2019s been a conditioning in the buyers of software to look at more term-based models to look at more consumption-based models, and people are much more comfortable with that. I think when we first started, there was a little bit of a negative reaction in certain accounts.  I think what\\u2019s happened, just to give you kind of the inside and the color commentary here, is that what has happened in a number of these accounts is that people are happier. They\\u2019re okay paying more if they feel like the software is really being used. There\\u2019s always this suspicion that they were buying things that were not being fully utilized, but now because of the tokens, they feel like it\\u2019s being used. The secondary dynamic that goes on within these accounts is that they can do some kind of an internal accounting about it and charge back to the cost center that\\u2019s using it. And I think the combination of those two things, plus the accessibility of the broader portfolio is winning over. And like we showed you at investor day, it\\u2019s pretty dramatic, the increase in usage, and company satisfaction as a result of the customers who have done this.\\nSteve Ashley : And just a quick follow up to Sterling\\u2019s earlier question on the enterprise flexible license agreements. He asked about the duration. You said while you didn\\u2019t have it at your fingertips, a lot of the deals are three years. Is the mechanics here that after a year you go in and do a true up and there is some maybe adjustment made or remuneration to you from these contracts?\\nCarl Bass : Yeah, there\\u2019s just the constant accounting, which people have tokens that they burn off. They buy what they think they need, and they eventually run out and have to buy more, a little bit more than a true up. I mean, it\\u2019s better just thinking of it as you just bought a bunch of tokens.  And I would say most people so far have guesstimated on the low side of what they need. And the reason why they guesstimate on the low side is they go out, they make the software available to the broader community, there\\u2019s more usage of it, and they end up having to go back and buy more tokens sooner than they would have otherwise thought they needed to. \\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.\\nMatt Hedberg: I wanted to ask about the geographies here. Obviously EMEA was your strongest geo. Carl, I\\u2019m wondering, was the strength there Autodesk specific with the transition ongoing here? Or are you seeing a different environment there than what some of the macro indicators might imply? And then also, APAC obviously grew 10% too in constant currency. Maybe a little additional color there?\\nCarl Bass : Let me just use this to riff on a broader thing I\\u2019m seeing geographically, which is the Americas is strong. There are a lot of good secular trends in the U.S. They remain strong. The places like the Middle East and Russia, Russia particularly, business might even be down by half in Russia over comparable periods. Just to put it in perspective, we\\u2019ve always been very interested in the emerging economies, but they\\u2019re in the low single digit percentages. None is bigger than 3% of our revenue. But Russia and the Middle East have been clearly weak. The other places have been okay. There\\u2019s a little bit of weakness that we\\u2019ve detected in Japan, coupled with a weakening of the currency, and the currency is as big an effect right now as the actual business.  Europe, the middle of this quarter, it seemed like there was a lot of consternation about Europe. I put it in not the strength of the U.S., but relatively strong, and even some signs of increasing strength in southern Europe, which I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ve been able to say for probably seven years. \\nMatt Hedberg : That\\u2019s very helpful, and then maybe a quick follow up. At analyst day, you talked about instituting a new campaign to lower the margin dollars on license sales and increase them on the desktop. So I\\u2019m curious, you\\u2019re 20 days into this. What\\u2019s been some of the initial feedback from the field on some of these changes?\\nCarl Bass : Yeah, so we\\u2019re just beginning. We said we were going to start with LT. You know, one of the things just in general that people should think about with this, LT is a very different product than our other products. It\\u2019s a good experimentation, it\\u2019s a high volume product for us. And so far, so good in terms of the reception to it. But also, it goes through, at least on a mix basis, a different channel than some of our other products. And just in general, when people look at this, I would say what people have to understand is that there\\u2019s a difference in products between LT and others, and the other thing I would say is as we do this, just keep in mind that the programs you put in place, either when the programs are new or the products are new, are considerably different than what you do as they mature.  So there\\u2019s a fair amount of flexibility. I mean, there are a number of degrees of freedom, depending on the product and the channel and the maturity of the product. So right now, longwinded answer. The short answer is the LT one is fine, and you\\u2019ll see us continue to do this as we work our way through the entire portfolio.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord.\\nRichard Davis: You bought, I was trying to remember, Moldflow, back in I think like \\u201908, Blue Ridge back in \\u201911, and I can\\u2019t remember if Delcam had much simulation. But anyways, what are your thoughts with regard to kind of organic and even inorganic growth in simulation, because it\\u2019s a less iterative design tool, and it works perfectly, I would think, with that kind of burst capacity relationship you have with Amazon Cloud?\\nCarl Bass : Two things there. One is we\\u2019ve always talked about the cloud being good for two reasons. One is for these computationally intensive tasks and the other really is the central coordinating hub for collaboration. Things like finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, are perfect for cloud-based computing. it works really well for those, as you say, burst, high peak demand needs. So we see it as being really good for that. It\\u2019s also, particularly as you move from the desk of the analyst to that of the engineer. In many large companies, they built out computing centers for the analysts, but not for every engineer. So it gives access for the average engineer to much more computing capability.  So we\\u2019re really happy with what we\\u2019ve seen, and I think the difference, when you look at us versus, you know, other companies in analysis and simulation, is we\\u2019re just much more focused on the engineer than the analyst, and some of the things we\\u2019re doing with the products should be viewed through that lens. \\nOperator: The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.\\nKash Rangan: Carl, when I look at your business model transition and follow along the commentary with the last couple of quarters, it feels like a lot of the upside in deferred revenue seems to be predominantly coming from flexible licensing agreements and also catch up maintenance. So where is the real business model transition happening here with respect to the Adobe-like desktop subs that you would like to pursue? And as it relates to that, when you look at fiscal \\u201918, if the company\\u2019s going to be in [unintelligible] licenses, which is terrific, how should we think about how you get to 30% non-GAAP [unintelligible], because the appeal of the license is going way. That seems like a steep [unintelligible].\\nCarl Bass : Two things, Kash. On your first question, I would say for example, forgetting everything else about the business model transition, I can\\u2019t think of a healthier way to grow your business than selling more value to your best customers.  It\\u2019s just as straightforward as that, and so call it token based or flexible licensing. Just the idea that your best customers are buying more products from you seems like everything about it is good. And in some ways, it answers your question, because the most sustainable thing is having good customers who want more products from you and are paying you more money for it.  The second thing is I think a number of people have looked and tried to draw conclusions too early in terms of the business model transition. What you saw this year was the end of a multiyear program to eliminate upgrades. What we\\u2019re heading into is a multiyear program to end perpetual licenses. At the end of that, the company is in a distinctly different place than it was when entering, where the primary means for your customers to buy things were perpetual licenses with upgrades. And you come out the other end, and everyone is in a recurring, ratable relationship with you. So I\\u2019d say that is fundamentally changing it. The difference - and I say this whether it\\u2019s Adobe or Microsoft or anyone else, or any of the born in the cloud SaaS companies - we all end up in an identical place. So you roll out three four years, and there will be virtually no difference, whether you\\u2019re talking about Salesforce or NetSuite or Workday or Autodesk or Intuit or Adobe or Microsoft.  It\\u2019s the software industry that\\u2019s changing. We\\u2019re all delivering software on the same platforms in the same way, and our customers, truthfully, are pushing us to buy it in the same way. So I think some of the distinctions in the transition maybe trying to put too fine a filter on it and trying to understand things that may not look identical in year two or year two and a half versus something else.  But if you just step back and look at the long term, you say, companies end up in the same place, we\\u2019re all selling enterprise applications that are centered around cloud, social, and mobile, and the business relationship with the customer will be a long term subscription model. And so in that way, I think is the easiest way to see the similarities.\\nKash Rangan : And on the implications for margins, certainly this is a thoughtful transition, but what I struggle with is as licenses fall off, the subscriptions, you have to cut a lot of cost to get to 30% non-GAAP margins versus the 13. Just wondering, what drives that? \\nCarl Bass : Yeah, so the first thing is, I think if you looked over any period of time, I would say there are two different things. So one I\\u2019ll get to, what costs have to change? But the first one is, the amount of revenue over time is the same, if not more. And we saw that with like the enterprise licenses. Customers are paying us more, even though there are no more up front licenses. And so the lifetime value or the value over a fixed period in time is actually higher. And I think that same trend that we see with our enterprise customers we\\u2019ll see with our other customers. As I\\u2019ve been very willing to say, repeatedly. I think the two areas where we will see a change is, one is our R&D spend is relatively high right now. We\\u2019re supporting two different technology models, a traditional desktop model and we\\u2019re building out for a SaaS infrastructure, and so we\\u2019re doing development infrastructure costs on both simultaneously. And the second one is our sales and marketing is high when you consider the total between what we spend and our various channel partners spend on sales and marketing. So I think if you combine those two, both of those, as a percentage, and certainly if you do the calculation on the overall ecosystem as opposed to us, goes down over time, and that\\u2019s how you get to 30-plus percent.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Williams from Evercore.\\nMatt Williams: Carl, just quickly on the partner side of things, I\\u2019m just wondering if you could give us an update on partner interest around rentals and clouds. I saw a press release earlier today around the PLM business and a partner that was announced there. And I\\u2019m just wondering sort of what sort of traction you\\u2019re seeing within the partner base around the PLM 360, BIM 360, some of the cloud offerings and how they\\u2019re adapting to the desktop subscription offering as well.\\nCarl Bass : Yeah, so I\\u2019ve seen more traction amongst our traditional partners around desktop subscription, because it\\u2019s the same products licensed differently. The pickup amongst our traditional partners has more variance when you get to these offerings like PLM 360 and BIM 360. So some partners have been greatly involved with it, but in other cases, we have actively gone out and recruited new partners whose business is already much more aligned with this. So some of our existing partners are much more willing to make the transformation, others\\u2026 Some of these, like the PLM deals, involve large amounts of services. We\\u2019ve talked about they are million dollar deals. For some partners, that\\u2019s a little bit much. Others are reacting really well. But I would say some of our newer offerings like BIM and PLM, you will see a higher proportion of new partners entering the mix and desktop subscription. The bulk of that work will be covered by our existing partners. \\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Koenig from Wedbush.\\nSteve Koenig: I joined the call a little late, so I apologize if this has been asked. I wanted to go to the subscriber additions for next year, where you\\u2019re expecting a fairly similar level to this year. In light of maybe an update after the Q3 now, any thoughts on where these subscribers will be coming from? Are you still thinking about desktop subscribers as being a priority for next year? I guess if that\\u2019s true, maybe just a little bit of color on what kind of people would you be targeting in that 3 million base of active but not really paying users that haven\\u2019t chosen the upgrade this year but might go to a desktop subscription next year? Or am I thinking about this wrong?\\nCarl Bass : No, I think if you look at next year, without getting too quantitative about it, I think with the end of perpetual licenses, you\\u2019ll see a large number of people going to desktop subscription as a result of recognizing, as they get nudged toward doing that. You\\u2019ll also see, just based on the maturing of the products, more people going to cloud-based subscriptions.  And the last one is, I think there will be a substantial number of people who move to maintenance along with perpetual licenses. For those who want to continue to buy this way, and as that\\u2019s removed, they will go buy perpetual licenses with maintenance to stay in that mode. So I think you\\u2019ll see a substantial portion of maintenance subscribers next year, but you\\u2019ll see an increasing number of desktop and cloud.\\nOperator: I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. \\nDavid Gennarelli: Thanks, operator.

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Autodesk Q4 Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to our host, Mr. David Gennarelli, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\\nDavid Gennarelli - Director-Investor Relations: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2015. Also on the line is Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investors. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the first quarter and full-year fiscal 2016, our long-term financial model guidance, the factors we used to estimate our guidance, our transition to new business models, our market opportunities and strategies, and trends for various products, geographies and industries. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment, based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2014, Form 10-Q for the periods ended April 30, 2014, July 31, 2014, and October 31, 2014, and our current reports on Form 8-K, including 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.

Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks, and on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal 2015 was the first year of our business model transition, and we are really pleased with the results. In addition to the strong financial performance, we are particularly pleased with the rollout, and acceptance of our new cloud-based products like Fusion 360, BIM 360 and PLM 360. As the world looks to cloud and mobile products to get the jobs done, we are being rewarded with thousands of news customers. Our fourth quarter results continue to show strength across industries, geographies and products. Key metrics like billings, subscriptions and deferred revenue showed strong year-on-year growth. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was a record. And we increased our recurring revenue base by adding a 100,000 net new subscriptions in Q4, bringing our full year to 385,000 net new subscriptions. Subscriptions process through the Autodesk eStore, increased more than 150% and we experienced strong sequential growth from non-maintenance subscriptions. All in all, it was terrific quarter and a strong close to the year. From a geographic perspective, strength was again broad based in Q4, anchoring this strength was large deal activities, which are transactions with a deal value greater than $1 million. Q4 was a record for large deals, with a number of transactions increasing more than 50% and the total deal value increasing more than 40% over the fourth quarter last year. That's another sign that we are becoming a more strategic partner to our largest customers. Many of these large deals were flexible enterprise licenses or EBAs, which create a recurring revenue stream and are recognized ratably. These EBAs drive deeper account penetration in which parts of the enterprise that we just weren't getting to previously. And these large deals also tend to includes buying decisions across the supply chain. As customers look to align their design software, for increased efficiency and compatibility with their suppliers. Fourth quarter license revenue would have been approximately $40 million higher without the impact of flexible enterprise license agreements. For the year, we transitioned close to $90 million in the enterprise license revenue to these recurring revenue streams. From an industry perspective, our strong Q4 results in AEC, can be attributed through the continued adoption of BIM in the building and infrastructure industries. We experienced strong growth in AEC suites, as well as our cloud and mobile products. These new technologies support access to in-field and real-time information. Our manufacturing team delivered strong growth in Q4 driven by large deals, strengthened our product design suite and the addition of Delcam. We are really encouraged by what we are seeing with our cloud-based products like Fusion 360 and PLM 360. For the first time in a long time, we are seeing fundamental changes in the competitive environment in manufacturing. The way products are being designed and built is changing, and customers are looking for tools to support these changes. Our cloud-based products Fusion 360 and PLM 360 are leading the market. Fusion 360 is a complete product development system that allows distributed teams to work together on a project from concept through manufacturing. Bringing together design simulation, visualization and fabrication tools into one product, is key for our products bringing better products to market faster. In terms of collaboration, the closest analogy for Fusion are gain up for software development or Google Docs for office documents. The range of customers and the work they're producing is really inspiring. We estimate that 90% of our Fusion accounts are new to Autodesk. So it's another way that we're expanding our user base. PLM 360 is also bringing new users to Autodesk and expanding our presence within existing accounts. We added over 50 new PLM logos in FY 2015 and many of these customers have already come back to us to expand their usage. While some of our PLM accounts are enterprise customers, the vast majority are S&P, which is a large Greenfield opportunity. We were the first cloud-based PLM solution to the market over two years ago and we've built a sizable technology lead, which now includes cloud-based data management. In Q4, we continued to see an increase in upgrade activity as legacy customers took the last opportunity to upgrade and a high percentage of the upgrades attach maintenance subscription. This is all good news, as the end of life for upgrades resulted in converting tens of thousands of customers so the latest version of our products and bringing them with us into the future and we still have a huge opportunity to convert nearly 3 million customers to subscription offerings. Now, I'd like to talk more about our model transition. At the heart of this transition is the dramatic shift in the software industry, total subscription and a technology platform shift to the cloud. Our customers are already seeing the benefits of the shift to the cloud and turn-based offerings with many of their other software applications, such as CRM or HR apps, and they are embracing the change. Our subscription offerings provide a simplified product management and deployment experience. They also make it easier to introduce new tools and technologies into the workflow with lower upfront costs. This is changing how our customers use our products to solve design challenges in ways that just weren't previously possible. We exited FY 2015 with even more conviction in our transition. In many ways FY 2015 was the set up for the next couple of years in which we will move a larger portion of our business to subscription and recurring revenue. Earlier this month we announced that we would stop selling new perpetual offerings for most of the standalone products such as AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT on February 1 next year. After which they will be available only through desktop subscriptions. We expect that this may lead some customers to buy new perpetual licenses before the change, while others will willingly choose the more flexible subscription offerings that provide increased functionality and new benefits. Throughout the course of the year, we'll be working with our customers and channel partners to help them make the choice that's best for them because of 100% of desktop and cloud subscription revenues deferred are recognized ratably. This will naturally puts downward pressure on traditional income statement metrics like revenue, operating margin, and EPS, through the transition. This pressure will increase the remaining perpetual license offerings have discontinued next year. At that point, nearly all revenue will come from ratably recognized offerings, including maintenance, desktop and cloud subscriptions and EBAs. Also keep in mind, there will continue to be pressure on gross margin as we invest in our cloud infrastructure and our sales of cloud services ramps up. On the flip side, the model transition will positively impact deferred revenue and subscription additions, which we expect will continue to have healthy growth rates. The traditional income statement metrics will start to rebound at the anniversary of the quarter in which we discontinue perpetual offerings. From there we would expect a material rebound in financial performance. Those considerations are factored into our guidance for FY 2016, which calls for 3% to 5% growth in both billings and revenue. Our FY 2016 guidance also reflects six points of currency headwinds for billings and four points of currency headwinds for revenue. In other words, our guidance for billings growth at constant currency would be 9% to 11%, and our guidance for revenue growth at constant currency would be 7% to 9%. Healthy growth rates over strong performance in FY 2015. To wrap things up, we're really pleased with the direction of the business. This past year shaped up to be much stronger than our initial view, and we remain confident in our long-term business model transition. Goals of 12% billing, CAGR 20% more customer value, 50% more subscriptions and 30% operating margins. We look forward to building on these early successes and transitioning Autodesk to a more profitable and recurring subscription based model over the coming years. Lastly, I want to thank our employees and partners for their outstanding efforts and contributions over the past year. It was a great team effort. Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.\\nOperator: Certainly. And our first question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nKeith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and very nice quarter. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color about how we're looking for this sort of transition from perpetual to subscription to unfold? You give us a very impressive subscriber guidance for FY16. Could you give us a little bit of understanding, namely, how you're going to try to incent customers to act \\u2013 whether you're going to be trying to push them more towards subscribers or desktop subscriptions in the near term? Or is it going to \\u2013 or is the pricing going to be equivalent between perpetual and professional desktop subscription?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Keith, thanks. Two things in the way that we're thinking about moving customers more towards desktop subscription. We would like them to move there, one is certainly as you \\u2013 it suggests through price, the other way to do it is, we will make sure that the offerings on desktop subscription have more value for the customers than the other. We will put things in those products that are not available in the traditional way. Having said that I think even last quarter I said the same thing. A customer who is happy buying perpetual licenses and subscriptions, we will \\u2013 we're going to continue to allow them to do it and move at their own pace, but what we're going to try to do is incent them do it rather than beat them with the stick to do it.\\nKeith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. What would be some of those incentives, outside of pricing?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As an example, some of the other cloud connected services.\\nKeith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So you will have access to them in one product, but not in the other, would be an example of something like that.\\nKeith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So a desktop subscription would have it, but the maintenance -\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Traditional one would not.\\nKeith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And we can do this differentially, how we're applying this consumption based models around things like cloud credits, so we can vary how many they have, we can vary what services they have access to. There were actually a fair number of knobs and dials in there. We're a little bit \\u2013 kid of little bit at this point to say exactly what they are, partially because we don't fully understand, we want to understand our customers reactions to the incentives as put them in place.\\nKeith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.\\nSteve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. I'd just like to ask about AutoCAD LT. I know that you were thinking of transitioning the pricing there from licensing to subscription. Just wondering where we are with that. And if there is a transition to subscription, is that having an impact on the revenue growth in that product group?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. We've started making desktop subscriptions available, customers are definitely taking advantage of it. LT is one of the places where it's a natural for a certain class of customers particularly those who are price sensitive for upfront \\u2013 upfront they have to pay. And yes, every customer we try to move to desktop subscription affects revenue in the short-term.\\nSteve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. And my other question was just around the EBA business. How did the amount of business you did in the fourth quarter compare to the amount you had done in the third quarter?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Substantially higher. Almost half of it was done in the fourth quarter.\\nRichard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, sequentially Steve it was more than double quarter-on-quarter. The number of transactions greater than a $1 million. So it was strong growth.\\nSteve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Perfect.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I'd just say in general, I mean, we have been \\u2013 I can't say it's strong, how great the EBA business has been, just in general, the investment we made in working with our large customers. This came about a number of years ago, where we recognized that we really build an incredibly strong portfolio of products and even some of our best customers didn't know about it. And in many ways some of our more traditional channels were not in a position of convincing the largest companies in the world of what we actually had. And so we made a fairly large investment in selling direct or selling in conjunction with our best partners and it has made a huge difference and I think as we outlined at our Analyst Day, we still think there's a lot more there. So we still think this is a big source of growth over the next few years and each quarter keeps improving it.\\nSteve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS. Please go ahead.\\nBrent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Carl, on manufacturing, it was surprisingly strong, versus what some of your competitors have said. I'm curious what you're seeing, in terms of share gains versus your peers. Combined with execution, what would you say that you're seeing there? And I had a quick follow-up for Scott.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Brent. I think there are two aspects. So one, on the little bit more bearish, I think I fall into the same category of some of our competitors around the worldwide economy. I mean, in that way, I mean there is a little bit of noise in the emerging economies, I think for manufacturing, the place that probably gives all of us the most concerned is Japan, that despite all their efforts, they just can't seem to jumpstart the economy. So, there is a little bit of macroeconomic concern on the much more bullish side. I think there are two things going on right now. I think we've had solid execution. As I said in the previous answer to Steve, I think we have great offerings for our customers that we built over a long period of time. The second thing that's adding to this is what we are doing on the cloud. A number of our competitors have just chosen at this point not to do anything substantial there. And I think this will change over time, I don't think this is an advantage that we will have forever, but we invested heavily in PLM 360, we just brought the part of PLM that most people think of this PLM, really data management or document management to the cloud, which greatly expands the opportunity there. What we are doing in the Fusion 360 is really kind of reinventing how CAD will be used in the future. So, and I think people are recognizing it. The reason why I led in about our estimate of 90% new users is both in PLM and in Fusion, those are all share gains. Every one of those is not a new CAD or PLM customer. They've been using previous things and as we've surveyed what they're using, they're coming from the very traditional legacy products. And so, we're really pleased with that. And so, that's certainly helping our growth.\\nBrent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And just as a quick follow-up for Scott on operating margins, 13% to 15% guided. It seems fairly conservative, assuming that you still want to hit your 30% ramp. Maybe if you could just walk through that progression and what you think is going to be the big impact this year on margins, given your size. I think everyone was hoping for a little bit more.\\nRichard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure, Brent. If you look at our Q4 results, you see Op margins that are in the just below 13% range. So, but we are looking for improvement year-on-year. And I think there's a couple of things that are driving that. One is obviously, top line growth, albeit muted by some of the FX impacts. The second is, we are \\u2013 I think the team has done a really nice job of looking to rebalance and reprioritize everywhere they can, so that as we make some of these required investments to make the business model transitioned, whether it's investments we have to make in the sales team or inside the R&D teams or back-office systems and cloud infrastructure, we're doing a lot of that by rebalancing internally. So, you see kind of the implied spend growth for fiscal 2016, despite of the lower than the spend growth that you saw on fiscal 2015, and those are the things that are contributing to the Op margin for next year.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think just in general, as you think about the transition Brent, the more successful we are at transitioning quickly, it's just arithmetic that revenue and EPS, and margin get affected by it. And I think we've looked at this quite closely and we decided that, on balance the best thing we can possibly do is move as quickly as we can, mostly modulated by our customers' needs. So, that's really what's been driving. And so, we want to move quickly and to the extent that we're more successful at it, it has an arithmetic impact. On the other hand, every one of those dollars that you see on the booking side, is money in the bank that comes back to the operating margin and EPS.\\nBrent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC: Understand. Thanks.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\nHeather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. I have two quick questions. One, Carl, I was wondering if you could share with us, I know you've had some initiatives underway where you were trying to reduce your churn rate in Q4 and focus on trying to drive higher renewal rates. I was wondering if you could share with us some of the success you might have seen from some of the initiatives you've been put in place. And then the second question just follows up on what Brent was asking. If we look beyond this year, at analyst day, you talked about how you thought you could keep OpEx growth sub 5%, as you look out. And that last year was a [year in] investment, and it seems like this year you're getting some investment. Obviously, we get the model transitions. But is there, can you give us some clarity as how you see the company growing OpEx as you look out beyond this year? What's required, in terms of investments? Thank you.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Yeah. I think both Scott and I, can jump in on both of these. I mean, bunch of positive stuff about making sure that more customers attached and renewed. And this one was in the \\u2013 this was in a camp of simple execution. We just started paying attention to it and measuring it and putting people, giving it to people, as a day job, working with \\u2013 closely with our partners and we did \\u2013 we've done much better.\\nRichard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, and the results \\u2013 Heather, on the renewal rates, we obviously don't close that, but I'll tell you the results year-on-year, both in the Q4 and for the full year, attached rate and renewal rate are both up materially year-on-year. But I think some of the disciplined and some of the increased focus that we put in place is a clearly paying dividends and as we see people making final purchases on upgrades and I think the same phenomenon will continue on final purchases on perpetual license, you see a very high attached rate, that also will bring along with it a high renewal rate.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. On the OpEx spend, I mean what we see is slightly higher than 5% growth in OpEx for this year, but that's kind of the area where we've been looking over the next three years, that kind of growth rate. Some of it is coming back from last year. We've built a hole, in some of the compensation programs, that really filled back in. The other thing is, again, as we've decided \\u2013 as we've seen such success and wanted to accelerate the transition. There are two things that are consuming some of that is building out the cloud infrastructure to support that in terms of the stuff that supports actual customers and the other is the back office infrastructure, which needs to change fairly dramatically in order to support a very new business model. And so, those are the places to really think of it. A lot of the rest, looks like cost of living and then Scott already mentioned. We're doing a lot to move expenses from one part to the other. It's opaque from your point of view, but there is a lot of movement of expenses from one place to the other.\\nHeather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Welcome.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\\nJay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good evening. Carl, I'd like to ask about the composition of your subscriber ads, that is to say, the sources of those numbers. Back at the analyst meeting, you talked about 2.9 million active users who were not, however, paying maintenance or subscription. It looks to us like the largest piece of that \\u2013 or at least as large \\u2013 is the BLP piece is what you've called upgraded but not attached. And that works out to at least 1.3 million. And what do you think the conversion rate could be of that very large base of non-subscribers, as part of your guidance for this year? And then secondly, with respect to the constant currency billings growth for FY16, that's a couple of points better than we had assumed. And yet, you've got at least a 10 point headwind for billings growth from the absence of upgrades, given that you seemingly had record upgrades in FY15. So perhaps, you could rank the sources of billings growth from the other components. For example, perpetuals, rentals, EFLAs. How are you thinking about the build to the billings growth from the various sources?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, two things about it, Jay. So, on the first one, I think your model might me more detailed than ours. I'm not sure if I could actually tell you exactly where are you, I'm being slightly facetious here, but some of the customers actually kind of putting a tag on them and realize which bucket they're coming from, it's a little bit hard, because of the way, they may have been a customer and then re-enter with a new one or the way they've switched. So, it's a little bit harder to tag precisely than you might imagine. When you get to looking forward, there was a big question mark that I tried to outline in kind of the prepared remarks was, we're not quite sure we did a number of experiments, but there are really two possible behaviors going forward as we get rid of perpetual licenses. Some of our customers will definitely choose to hoard those licenses, if you will, they like the way they buy it now, they'd like to buy more of those, and others will see the advantages with the new model and move to flexible licensing. That's one of the big variables out there. We modeled primarily on the overall number. The number of people that will get new licenses, and most of the variability in our modeling is around how much is in the first pile versus how many people are in that second pile. And as we see the year play out and as we move into the first quarter and second quarter, we will be able to give you a little bit clearer guidance on what we're seeing, but, right now, we're shooting a little bit in the dark to know in which group they exactly fall into.\\nRichard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Jay, this is Scott. The only thing I would add to that is what we saw with the end of life of upgrades this year's very high attach rate on maintenance. And if so, of course, we'll get that tail through next year in the revenue stream; on the billing side, I think, we expect to see that same kind of high attach rate to the customers that decide to buy perpetual and hoard, right.\\nJay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.: Yeah.\\nRichard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So, I think there is besides though, the mix of which way they buy, I think we'll also see a very high acceptance.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean, I think, if you look really the gates we've setup is that, in the end, regardless of the way they buy, they end up as a subscriber.\\nJay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.: Thank you.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome, Jay.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\\nPhilip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, guys. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a great quarter and outlook. I want to focus in on vertical by industry because, Carl, I know you talked a lot about \\u2013 you can't talk about by geography, just geographies or industries. When you think about what led to the improving growth that you guys have seen, does any vertical by geo stand out to you that has gotten better versus what you saw in the past? As you all contemplate the billings guidance for this year, how did you incorporate some of those changes versus, let's say, what verticals by geo were running at previously?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'll give you my impression, Scott feel free to jump in. I've started out when the U.S. was strong and I mean, U.S. Re was strong all through the year, and that made a big difference. I think there have been some nervousness around Northern Europe and Central Europe, that did pretty well. And for much of the year, many parts of Asia did well, like I said, the places that are on my radar right now in terms of the ones I'm more worried about, are Japan and obviously Russia. Russia business has been reduced dramatically, and I worry on an ongoing basis, and in Japan despite all the economic stimulus and government action, they seem somewhat enabled to jump start more growth. And both of those are important markets for us. So, that's the part I worry about. I think if you look more broadly, I think there is two things going on in different industries. I think the adoption of BIM in Asia, is still a big thing. It's not nearly fully adopted. I might even guess that it's half. There is still a lot of way to go. We're seeing lot more government initiatives, we're seeing lot more projects, beginning to adopt it. And so we're still in the middle of a very strong technology transition, within the AEC industry, that's actually many ways getting broader as it reaches out to construction companies, when we talked about through mobile technologies, it gets there delivering real time information in the field. On the manufacturing side, I think there is \\u2013 as has been historically true, lots of pressure on manufacturers. They're looking for better ways to develop products, they're looking for new answers. Many of our traditional competitors have kind of turned their back on medium potatoes if you will of the industry, of giving people CAD software that actually gets their job done and making better software. And they've gotten interested in other parts and other ways of serving customers. And we've been happy to fill-in that void. And I think that's going to continue. The second thing is particularly the companies that are under a lot of pressure in terms of product innovation and reducing their time to market. They're really looking for new technology. They are looking how to figure out, how to manage distributed teams, building products, much more willing to kind of break the norms, look at cloud and mobile technology for both PLM and for CAD. And I think we're clearly the leader there, we've been out there with both of our CAD and PLM products for two years and that's making a huge difference.\\nRichard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Phil, the only thing I'd add is. Carl touched on lot of the bright spots, geographically. U.S. was bright, Germany was bright, across Northern Europe was bright. I think the other one that not quite at the same scale, but it was particularly strong in terms of growth there was China in Q4. So, you see the overall APAC growth rate and it's definitely weighted down by what's happening in Japan. I think what might be a little bit easier to point out is the places that things didn't go well, and Japan was one of those, Russia was one of those, and on a much smaller scale Brazil was one of those, but we had a little bit of tough quarter.\\nPhilip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Great, guys. Thanks a lot.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nMatt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Carl, what percentage of your business goes through the online store today? And what might that look like once we get through this transition? And maybe as a follow-up to that, how does the channel feel about this move to the online store, over time?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, right now, it's relatively small. The online store is a negligible for \\u2013 I mean, and it's \\u2013 the placement has any \\u2013 it's in the U.S., is certainly the largest proportion of that. The other thing that we have talked about for a long time, we've always used the, eStore as a way to base the prices. So everything there is at list price. And then, we don't control end user of pricing, but that is the one place where we do. So people tend to look at our eStore. They get reference prices from there, but more often the smaller customers transact in one or two ways with our more traditional partners or with some of the larger volume partners, I think, CDW or Dell, or Amazon. So it's much more a price reference. Now, I think as you go through this transition, I think there can be some change there on some of the things, and in particular I actually think this is going to be a win-win for us and our partners, the places where I'm most interested in seeing business go through the eStore for the transactions that are not cost effective for our partners. And I don't want to see our partners wasting their time on things where they don't make money. And if we can provide electronic ways to do that that's great. Second thing, I'd say is we're starting to see electronic outlooks popup through our partners and distributors. And it's clearly the way some of our customers want to buy. So, I think there will be a greater variety of choices out there, but for all of us it's driving greater efficiency in the business.\\nMatt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's great. Very helpful. Thank you.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome, Matt.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord. Please go ahead.\\nRichard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Carl, I have my own opinions, but I was curious what your thoughts are. A lot of your competitors are not aggressively switching to cloud. You guys are. Look, I mean, I think you're on the right side of history. Are you seeing any, I mean, you see it in the numbers, but how do you think about, would people just go, Oh, man, I don't want to do this cloud stuff. It's CB radio with more typing, or whatever? And would you lose people in that? Is there any risk of that, or how do you triangulate around that? Thanks.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, sure. That's a funny question, Richard. But it's a serious question. So, let me answer it this way. There are certainly customers now who don't see the cloud is the inevitability that I see it. And for them we continue to offer desktop products, there is the intermediate ground of desktop connected products. So, you can continue to work like you did behind the firewall relatively isolated. You can also work in ways that allow you take advantage of cloud services. So, you get some, but maybe not all of the benefits. So you can kind of modulate your behavior, according to your tolerance. On the other hand, it's \\u2013 I guess I've been around long enough and watched enough of these transitions to recognize kind of the inevitability. And, I was around when people said CAD will never be done on a PC, it has to be done on the mainframe, I was there when it said, you can never design a car on a PC, it had to be done on a workstation. Every car in the world today is designed on a PC. And in the same way, every bit of enterprise software is moving to the cloud. You've already seen it, it happened with ERP, and HR, and CRM. So you look at what's going on and it's very hard to imagine a world in which all of your IT is cloud-based except somehow some part of product development. It makes very little sense, and particularly I think there is a better reason other than just kind of this inevitability argument, that I think is important. If you think of the challenges that most companies are wrestling with, they build these products in large distributed teams. Many of them will tell you whether this is the supply chain and manufacturing or the companies that come together in construction, that the biggest problem is in communication and coordination. So in some ways, there is nothing particularly rationale about having a behind the firewall solution for a constellation of companies and people that need to work together, that what you really want is the IT structure to mirror the structure \\u2013 the economic structure of the people participating and I think the cloud serves that. I've outlined this before, but if you just wanted to go, get down to press tax with the cloud through our customers, there is two big things thus far. It gives them the ability to do large, on-demand computing for their most difficult engineering problems, and whether that's analysis, simulation or visualization, that is an important part. The second one is a less computing intensive task, but really critical to what they do every day, which is this coordination, and collaboration. And the cloud is a central coordination point, and as you watch many of the other companies in the different parts of the industry, gain these advantages, it all comes about by having the centralized coordinating point. So, three years or four years ago, when we started on this journey, I think it was a lot more suspect. I think, as the days go by, you get more and more convinced that we're \\u2013 we're certainly on the right side of the history on this one.\\nRichard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Got it. Thanks.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\nSterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I was wondering, I think you pushed back the actual elimination of the upgrade price by 30 days, if I'm not mistaken.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah.\\nSterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Any sense of what that actually did to the subscriber count in the quarter, meaning, obviously, that spilled it over into the first quarter. But any way to quantify that?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. That's really hard for us to tell. All we saw was that there was a huge rush at the end. And, because of that, we wanted any of our customers who wanted to take advantage of it. We did and we just gave a little bit of an outlet to it, so that \\u2013 they had a little bit more time, for whatever reason, they were enable the process fee orders in that timeframe. So, but it's hard for us. I mean we will see the spike and at the end of quarter we'll know much more about it, but it's really hard for us to predict right now what it is.\\nSterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then, in terms of the transition, you mentioned a year from when you eliminate perpetual, you'll start to see the rebound. What I'm curious about is, what do you anticipate being the end of the transition? In other words, is it three years until you go through the customer base and get back to the point where the income statement would be \\\"normalized\\\"?\\nRichard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, Sterling. This is Scott. I think the \\u2013 thinking through the elimination of perpetual which we've already announced for a standalone products, we saw a perpetual license out there for suites and haven't made an announcement there yet, but have said the 12 months to 24 months from the time that was announced that the all perpetual new license sales would end. At that point you anniversary the date of the last sales of perpetual license and that's when some of the traditional methods that are in the P&L like reported revenues, and then down the stream into op margin and EPS will also begin to get back to a steady state. So I like exactly what Carl said in the opening commentary, at the point that we anniversary the quarter where there's no more perpetual license sales is where we start to hit a more steady state again.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The only thing I'd remind everyone because we've had lots of questions on this, is during that period it doesn't have to be blind faith. I mean as we've shown is billings and subscriptions both matter and they will be going \\u2013 we've talked about how they will rise substantially and you can track that. And...\\nSterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Deferred revenue.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And deferred revenue certainly. As you watch those other metrics and in some ways what we're saying is the metrics change, really, around just the calculations involved, but you can \\u2013 they are almost perfect proxies for the health of the business. So, I think you can look at that. When we come out of it, I think it maybe in a different \\u2013 maybe different place, again we'll go back to revenue and op margin, EPS being more normalized. But they're still maybe more interest in billings and subs and deferred revenue, just because of the model transition. So, if anything I think at the end, there will be more metrics that give an indication of the health of the business, but through the transition there is plenty to look at to gauge our progress.\\nSterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, that's certainly the case. And we saw that with Cadence Design and Aspen Technology and Ariba and a number of others that have gone through this. But one of the questions that always comes up, and we're seeing this more recently with Aspen technology, that's finishing their transition, is where you come out. So when you eliminate perpetual, you're going to have the inevitable dip in that first year. That second year, your revenue, probably, doesn't make it back to where it was previously because the layering effect, I wouldn't imagine, unless there's going to be something different here. So that's why I'm asking when do you get at least back to where you started before the elimination of perpetual, maybe use that as the gauge?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's really, Sterling, a question of the rate and pace that our customers move from traditional licensing over to desktop \\u2013 our desktop subscription license or to cloud. And we are working that process beginning this year to try and move people as quickly as we can over to the some of the newer subscription and ratable revenue model styles. But the rate and pace that they adopt that will really dictate what the shape of the curve is when it's finished.\\nRichard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. Unlike you saw this year, I'm really pleased with the results, but we were imperfect in our projection of what would happen this year. We didn't truly understand it at the beginning and it turned out to be very good and when we certainly course corrected along the way and I expect through the next year or two we will be doing the same as we gauge the behavior of our customers and partners, relative to the offerings we're putting out there.\\nSterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right, super, thank you.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nSaket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in, here. First, maybe for Scott, in terms of license revenue this year, you've obviously got a headwind from the discontinuation of the upgrade program, perhaps some headwind from proactive customers ahead of your perpetual license deadline, and then, maybe a little bit of tailwind from perpetual license hoarding. So a lot of moving parts. How should we think about where license revenue ultimately ends up this year, with all those different moving parts?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Saket we're not going to obviously provide guidance at that level of granularity, but I will tell you that what's going to drive the growth of perpetual this year is the announcement around end of life on standalone products. So if you look at the prepared remarks the document with all the 17 pages worth of data, one of the statistics in there is 37% of our revenues are suite base, right. So you can begin to, then, peel back to what is standalone product-based. And then on the license side, it's probably a little bit higher than that 37% number. So think of that chunk of our license revenues and that customer set, having a last opportunity to buy perpetual license. That's what's going to drive the license line. On the subscription line it's the same trend that we saw this year, it's high attach rate on the upgrade sales that will continue through the year and turn into maintenance revenues. Also high attach rate we expect on perpetual license sales, as we hit that end of life toward the end of the year. So, those things will drive the subscription line.\\nSaket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Got it. And then, for my follow-up, you said that perpetual will, effectively, be gone in the next, in roughly 24 months. Have you thought about, or, rather, how have you thought about the behavior of your customers that are buying perpetual license for suites, in terms of your guidance? Do you think they pause for a potentially similar change, maybe seeing the writing on the wall, or how have you thought about that for 2016?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think there's, I mean, I think, there are a handful of customers who are following this very closely. I think many customers actually contemplate these things on an as needed basis. We certainly, due to some degree, follow this much more closely than most of our customers. I think the customers who're paying really close attention can, we've more than telegraphed. We've explicitly said what the plan has been, and we've talked about it for at least a year. So, I think they understand it. Unlike I said before, I think there are two behaviors that will drive, some people will decide to buy ahead of the announcement, and others will decide to move to a more flexible offering. And as we go through this year, we'll be able to figure out what's there. I think the other thing we're able to do is, I think we're able to kind of turn the dials to adjust what we've \\u2013 what we'd like to see.\\nSaket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Very helpful. Thanks.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.\\nBrendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities LLC: Thanks so much. Carl, following up on Sterling's question about these model transitions, as he said, we've seen them a few times. And one of the things that we have looked at has been free cash flow in lieu of EPS. As we think about this model transition, would free cash flow be likely to bottom next year? And when might we start to see that inflection and turnaround in free cash flow, knowing that's going to come, probably, ahead of the changes in the more traditional revenue and EPS metrics.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Brendan, we're not going to obviously forecast fiscal 2017 at this point. I would tell you though the free cash flow and the operating cash flows will follow closely along with the billings as opposed to anything in the \\u2013 reported revenues in the P&L.\\nBrendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\\nGregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Carl, you mentioned that you saw a strong consequential growth from non-maintenance subscriptions, which I think is a little different than what you've called out before. Can you elaborate what you saw on that front? Was that strength really from the EBAs, or was there a change as well with regards to desktop subscription and your cloud?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In both.\\nRichard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It is both.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Both things strongly grew. And, like I said, I think desktop, desktop subscriptions will have a more consistently increasing profile, whereas I think EBAs will still be subject to that seasonality. But I think both will be \\u2013 we'll continue on an upward trend, but what I was referencing, both of those substantially grew.\\nGregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Terrific. And then, just a follow-up to Brent's question earlier. Just wondering if you're still comfortable with reaching 30% operating margins by FY18. It would seem pretty difficult to get there if you only end up doing 13% to 15% this year.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. One of the things I would just say is that, as you work your models, it's very different when you're at 13% or 15%. Because your expenses and revenue aren't aligned, when it comes about because of the way we account for it, in some ways you are putting money in the bank. And so, the growth rate that you can see in EPS or operating margin is dramatically different than happens under normalized conditions. In some ways, the dollar you put away today that you don't recognize comes back even though to some extent, most of the expense of that has already been \\u2013 we've already spent that money. So, I think we've spent a lot of time looking at this and what you get as you come out of this is dramatic increases, unlike increases we've seen in any other year and that speaks to the how well we will do in that year. What we're really doing is we're just putting money in the cookie jar right now. And so, I think if you look at it through that lens \\u2013 kind of simplistic corner store mentality lens, you kind of get it, the only reason it's not dropping to the bottom line now is through the accounting rules, not due to the fundamental economics of the business.\\nGregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Please go ahead.\\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks. I'm wondering there's a lot of moving parts in the subscriber numbers. And I'm wondering when you think you'll be in the position, or what are you looking for to take place before you're going to start to give us some more visibility into the composition of the subscribers that you have and that you add every quarter?\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Walter. The subscriptions numbers are still overwhelmingly driven by maintenance subscriptions. And so, while we're seeing strong growth in both cloud and desktop, certainly strong growth year-on-year but sequentially very strong growth in those numbers, they're still small and so we're still overwhelmingly driven by maintenance subscriptions as the other two become material, and we think there is a benefit in breaking that out, of course we'll do so.\\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And then, Scott, I guess related to that, we've noticed on your website, you're doing a pretty significant discount for the desktop subscription on an annual basis. And should we start thinking about the desktop subscription pricing and the maintenance pricing coming together and, ultimately, the offerings also coming together? To some degree that, once somebody is on them they have the same value. I guess you've talked about providing maybe some more value on the desktop side. But should we start to think about those two coming together in terms of.\\nRichard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No, I wouldn't think about it that way, as we talked about before, we've said in the first year, we can provide incentives for folks to get there. There is nothing that says we need to do that in subsequent years. And I'd really think of the economics of each of these customers differently. The other customers have paid a large upfront amount and to some degree deserve to pay less per year, whereas the ones who get this lower upfront cost can pay more over time. But I think in terms of getting people into the system, we will definitely continue to experiment with different price points and see what the results of that are. That's one other things that we've talked about. But if I read through the lines, and what you're saying I would not model these two things as identical, I think that would be a large mistake.\\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The other lever there, Walt, of course is to use value, to attract customers to the cloud and desktop offerings based on the value that they provide and differentiate the value of those offerings versus maintenance.\\nWalter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, understood.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\\nKasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thank you very much. Can you give us a quick update on the folks that have installed licenses but are not on maintenance? I think there was an emphasis on getting as many of them as possible on subscription be it maintenance or pure subscription. And I believe that program also had a finite time period. Can you give us an update on how that is coming along? And also, with respect to the variability of customers falling under either a subscription, the different kinds, how confident are you in your targets? Because the targets seem to be fairly firm in FY18 of a certain level of billings and operating margin implying a certain level of earnings. It feels like there is a fair amount of variability between the two buckets. Just wanted to get your comments on that because that was said about a year back, but obviously things have come together in a different way. Just wanted to get your feel for that. Thank you.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So what I would say in the short-term, I think looking at the short-term of moving the millions of people who are non-subscribers on. I think this will be an ongoing thing. I don't think there is any short-term phenomena there. I think there will be incentives. We will continue to be incentives. The places that we encourage them to move will change as a programs change. But many of the 3 million customers are happy loyal customers and what we're trying to do is change the commercial arrangement between us. And we will continue to do that by making a variety of offerings. So there is nothing like that ended or expired. There is still a lot of options in terms of how we go and addressing ways to get those customers into the new model.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\\nSteve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, gentlemen, for taking my question. You know, you spoke a little bit about the experiments you've run and how the different types of new flexible offerings might play out. I'm curious to get a little bit more color, perhaps, on subscribe to Autodesk, given that's more of a, maybe it could be seen as a replacement for the suites, a little bit more holistic approach to using a broad range of Autodesk products. Is that more impactful next year, as those licenses for other products besides the standalone products get curtailed, or does that have traction this year? How important is that in the next, say, 12 months to 18 months...\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Steve, I think you hit the nail on the head, I think it's a really important point. Yeah, what we're seeing is subscribe to Autodesk, which is a flexible licensing program for everyone from our smallest to our midsize customers, the people who aren't involved in like those EBAs. Those are mostly replacements, in our mind, for suites. Certainly some people have single products, will also find that attractive, it also starts to deal with some of the network licensing things even on our single products. There is a network licensing component, many of our customers even on the LT deploy these in groups and subscribe to Autodesk begins to address that as well. We hadn't announced detailed plans, but just to answer your question more pointedly, it will have the bigger impact of following year than it will this year.\\nSteve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot, Carl. That's all I got.\\nCarl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Got it.\\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session. I'll now turn it back to David Gennarelli for closing remarks.\\nDavid Gennarelli - Director-Investor Relations: That concludes our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can reach me at 415-507-6033. Thanks.\\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your attendant.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our investor relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the third quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of $1.19 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to walk you through. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of $159 million primarily associated with the early debt redemption costs of $476 million; acquisition and integration-related charges of $137 million primarily pertaining to Oath; and a pension and benefit remeasurement credit of $454 million. The net impact after tax was approximately $120 million or $0.03 per share resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $1.22. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter up 3.1% compared to $0.98 a year ago. It has been three quarters since the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The effect of this change is illustrated within the table on slide 4. As a reminder, it results in a reduction of wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue and the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change has been fairly consistent during all three quarters of 2018 with a $0.06 per share impact in the third quarter. We continue to expect the accretive benefit to full year earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.31. The accretive benefit to operating income in 2018 is expected to moderate in 2019 and then become insignificant in 2020 as the timing impacts to revenues and commission costs converge. This will create year-over-year EPS pressure in both 2019 and 2020. For the remainder of this call, unless otherwise noted financial results will exclude the impact of this accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods. With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt to take you through the results for the quarter.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Brady, and welcome everyone to the first earnings call in the 5G era. Installations of 5Gs Home by Verizon, the world's first ever 5G commercial product, began earlier this month continuing our proud history of driving innovation. It is just the first service of many to come on this new and exciting technology. In the third quarter, we continued our strong operational and financial performance by executing on the fundamentals with laser focus while retaining and expanding our high-value customer relationships. Our methodical and disciplined capital allocation model affords us the flexibility to compete and win in the marketplace while investing in our best-in-class networks, strengthening the balance sheet, and returning value to shareholders. Also, during the quarter, our Board approved the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. Critical to our ongoing profitability is the work we are doing across our business excellence initiatives that are transforming all parts of our Company. In 2018, this has included adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, driving capital efficiencies from the network restructuring began last year, and more recently evolving our IT strategy and the announcement of the voluntary separation program. These initiatives are focused on positioning us to meet the rapidly evolving demands from our customers for years to come in a competitive environment. Let's move next to slide 6 to discuss our network and technology. During the quarter, we extended our leadership position, delivering the best network performance and overall experience to our valued customers. We won more J.D. Power awards than any other wireless provider for a record 21st time in a row and ranked highest in wireless network performance in all six regions of the U.S. In the most recent Nielsen report on streaming data quality, our reliable network ranks highest in video success ratings. And finally, we continue to extend our RootMetrics leadership position obtaining the highest percentage of wins nationally. While we are excited to be at the dawn of the 5G era, our 4G LTE network will continue to be a foundation of our services for many years to come. We continue to make enhancements to our 4G network through fiber and small cell densification as well as the deployment of new technologies to provide additional functionality and quality. 5G technology will provide meaningful value above the current network experience. At Verizon, we believe that true 5G requires an ultra-wideband solution, utilizing millimeterwave spectrum to address the full array of use cases that 5G enables. Our network preparation for nationwide 5G deployment requires deep fiber resources, a vast array of small cells, critical spectrum holdings and mobile edge computing capabilities. All of which we have been assembling for years. 5G Home by Verizon continues our legacy of consumer firsts. We are now providing wireless broadband service using millimeter wave spectrum. This revolutionary product offers customers a wireless in-home Internet experience with speeds and capacity that rival leading wide broadband products available today. The initial launch of 5G Home on proprietary standards in four markets positions us for a larger rollout in 2019. We are gaining valuable insights ahead of the industry that will drive refinements to the customer experience prior to the arrival of global standards-based equipment. We have said all along that we intend to be first not only in launching the world's initial 5G commercial product but also the first to deliver true 5G mobility to consumers. During the quarter, we completed the world's first end-to-end global standards compliant call with a smartphone test device using our network facilities in Minneapolis. As soon as devices and equipment are available the deployment of our 5G network on the global standard will begin for mobility and residential broadband in the new 5G ultra-wideband era. Let's turn to slide 7 and take a closer look at consolidated financial highlights of the quarter. On a reported basis third-quarter consolidated revenue was $32.6 billion up 2.8%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard total revenue was $32.5 billion up 2.6%. The primary driver of the increase was improved wireless service revenue due to customer step-ups to higher access plans and an increase in the average connections per account. On a consolidated basis excluding special items third-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% which was up from prior year's margin of 36.0%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.4 billion or 3.4% due primarily to wireless service revenue performance as well as continued improvement in operational efficiencies across the business. Our business excellence initiatives have produced cumulative cash savings of $1.3 billion year-to-date, from a mix of capital and operational expenditure activities. The program remains on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative savings for the four-year period. Let's now focus on cash flow results on slide 8. During the third quarter we continue to drive strong cash generation. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $26.2 billion an increase of $9.8 billion from the prior year. This was driven by strong operating results supplemented by the benefits from tax reform and the completion of the transition of device payment plan securitization to on-balance sheet financing. Year-to-date capital spending of $12.0 billion supported the increased demand on our industry-leading 4G network, the launch of 5G Home, earlier this month, significant fiber deployment in markets nationwide and pre-positioning for additional 5G services. We now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be between $16.6 billion and $17.0 billion. This reflects the benefits from our business excellence program which has allowed us to make all of the planned investments while aggressively advancing the 5G ecosystem and transforming our structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network. This architecture will provide both CapEx and OpEx efficiencies compared to the networks of the past. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $14.2 billion year-to-date. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility. We continue to maintain near-term maturities at low levels which give us confidence to operate through different financial market environments. We ended the quarter with $112.9 billion of total debt, which was comprised of $103.7 billion of unsecured debt and $9.2 billion of on-balance sheet securitizations. We have made good progress this year towards our goal of strengthening the balance sheet. Operational cash flows and the benefits from tax reform have resulted in a decrease in our total debt of $4.2 billion year-to-date while allowing us to make discretionary contributions of $1.7 billion to employee benefit programs. This has driven a change in the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA from 2.6 times to 2.4 times since the beginning of the year. Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments starting with wireless on slide 9. Total wireless operating revenue increased 6.1% to $22.9 billion in the third quarter primarily driven by strong trends in service and equipment revenue. Wireless service revenue increased by 2.6% driven primarily by customer step-ups to higher price plans and an increase in average connections per account. Our mix and match unlimited offering provides customization options to suit the individual needs of our customers while providing a superior network experience. In the third quarter, equipment revenue increased 13.7% on a year-over-year basis driven by higher-priced handsets and increased sales of wearables. Our postpaid customer migration to unsubsidized pricing has stabilized to 83% of our phone base. Comparatively, the same quarter in the prior year was 78%. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone base had an outstanding device payment plan at the end of the quarter consistent with the prior year. The combination of service revenue growth and efficiencies gained within the business have led to segment EBITDA growth of $664 million, an increase of 6.7% year-over-year. For the quarter wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.4%. Let's now turn to slide 10 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. In the third quarter, wireless operational performance sustained momentum from the previous quarters by expanding our relationships and subscriber experience with postpaid customers. Total net phone editions were 295,000 compared to 275,000 last year including postpaid smartphone net addition of 510,000. Postpaid net ads totaled 515,000 including tablet net losses of 80,000 and other connected device gains of 300,000 led by wearables.\\\\ Our postpaid phone churn of 0.80% is a result of our network quality and reliability coupled with the diversification and personalization of our unlimited offerings. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.04% was up compared to 0.97% in the prior year. We expect postpaid phone churn to increase seasonally through the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. Total postpaid device activations of which approximately 80% were phones were down 1.4%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.0% down from 5.5% in the prior year. In the third quarter, prepaid net additions declined by 96,000 compared to an increase of 139,000 in the prior year. Within this we had smartphone net additions of 15,000. The change in the size of our overall prepaid base reflects our ongoing activity to focus our prepaid offerings on value-added segments. Now, let's move to our wireline segment on slide 11. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.7% in the quarter as growth in our high-quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by technology shifts and ongoing secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition. Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.8% driven by legacy core declines and cord cutting partially offset by Fios broadband growth. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.1% due primarily to our broadband offerings. Fios broadband Internet experienced growth of 54,000 customers due to demand for high-quality Internet connectivity. Fios video results continue to be impacted by ongoing shifts away from linear video offerings with losses of 63,000 in the quarter. Our Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets revenues declined by 4.0%, 6.3% and 7.0% respectively. Enterprise Solutions revenues declined by 3.8% on a constant currency basis. Results in each of these businesses reflect the pressures on legacy products and price compression, which at this time continue to offset the growth in fiber-based products. Segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 19.9%. We expect price compression on legacy products, secular trends and increasing content costs to continue to put pressure on the wireline margins. Let's now move on to slide 12 to discuss our media and IoT businesses. For third quarter, Oath revenue was $1.8 billion, which was 6.9% below the same quarter last year. We are seeing revenue pressure from search and desktop usage, which is more than offsetting positive growth in mobile usage and video products, including our distribution partnership with the NFL. Because search and desktop products make up the majority of the Oath business and we believe pressure in those sectors is likely to continue, we do not expect to meet our previous target of $10 billion of revenue by 2020. The leadership team at Oath is focused on returning to revenue growth by completing the integration of the legacy AOL and Yahoo! advertising platforms by year-end, implementing initiatives to realize synergies across all of our media assets and building services around our core content pillars of sports, news, finance and entertainment. Additionally, we are utilizing Oath's technical capabilities such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality across all of Verizon. In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $241 million. Total IoT revenue including Verizon Connect was up approximately 12% year-over-year. Let's now move to slide 13 to summarize our third quarter results. We remain focused on our strategy to invest in our networks while expanding our high quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance, while building momentum for our ultra-wideband 5G network. Our launch of the world's first commercial 5G product signals the beginning of an era that will transform the way people live and work. Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network enabling efficiencies throughout the core infrastructure and delivering flexibility to meet customer requirements at the edge of the network. We are excited about our current positioning in the marketplace our financial strength and the opportunities ahead of us. With that I will turn the call back to Brady, so we can get to your questions.\\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Matt. Brad we are now ready to take questions.\\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks and two if you don't mind. I just want to come back to CapEx and the lower outlook there, it sounds like you are certainly enjoying some efficiencies as a result of your cost savings program. I am wondering if there are any timing considerations. So for example are we in maybe a little bit of an air pocket as you ramp down the 4G spend but you haven't quite hit run rate on 5G? And then on ARPA you continue to see some strength there. I was hoping you could deconstruct that a little bit. How much of it is strong product level ARPU trends particularly in phones as people take unlimited? And to what extent is it being driven as more devices are attached to accounts? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks Brad. Good morning. So on CapEx you certainly see the benefit of our operational excellence activities we have been doing throughout the year. This really started a year ago when we reorganized the network organization and we are seeing the benefits of some changes and how we run that organization using new capacity utilization models, changes to our inventory management systems, adoption of procurement analytical tools and a whole host of other things. So this is activity that began last year. It is showing up this year. I will tell you we are getting everything done that we wanted to get done in 2018. We are just doing it more efficiently than we initially originally expected to. And I don't see - you used the word air pockets. I don't see an air pocket here. We have been pre-positioning the network for the transition from 4G to 5G for a number of years now. So we will get into obviously our views on 2019 and beyond when we talk again in January. But we've got everything done this year we expected to. And the team has done a great job of just doing it more efficiently so that will open up more opportunities for us as we go forward. On the ARPA side as you mentioned we've certainly seen some good increase this year and it's been largely coming from step-ups. We have been seeing an increase in connections per account. But as we get customers onto unlimited and they see the quality of the experience there and then they step up from one plan to another plan we have been seeing some good overall results in ARPA. I will tell you there is still a good amount of runway there as well. So excited with the momentum that we have in wireless at the moment and I think there is still some way to go with it.\\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brady, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead with your question.\\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot. Good morning. Matt. you talked about 5G quite a bit. I don't know if there is any early commentary that you can give us on the launches and what you are seeing so far. And then as we think about next year and I think you said you would accelerate that. What is the timeline looking at like in terms of getting the standards-based gear and in particular a path to having a self-installed solution for 5G Home? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Simon. So, yeah, as you say we're excited that we are now in the 5G era. I will add that we started doing installs earlier this month. And we've seen performance as we've expected since we started doing those installs. The technology works, our customers are getting the experience they expected and we are getting a lot of good learning which will benefit us next year when we roll-out the product to that much larger audience. 5G Home will become more significant as we expand coverage and we get on the global standards equipment in 2019. And I would expect that that would start to have an impact on consolidated revenues as we get into 2020 and beyond. And you mentioned self-installs. A big part of what we are learning in these four markets is that install process. So when we get to rolling out across a broader geography on the global standard next year, we will just have a level of learning about the customer experience that will differentiate us from everyone else.\\nSimon Flannery: Okay. So is that sort of mid-2019 that we start to see this gear coming on in scale?\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, we are really dependent on the industry to develop it. We will be ready to deploy both on the network side and the customer side when the equipment is ready whether that be from the network OEMs or the customer equipment manufacturers. So sometime in 2019, we will push the industry to get there as quickly as possible and we will see how soon that happens.\\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead with your question.\\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Matt, could you kind of elaborate a little on the voluntary separation program. You know what the goal is? What the timetable is and what the margin impact is expected to be? And where we see that across the wireline and wireless organizations? And then the second question is with respect to delevering you've had good success there on the back of the cash flow windfall from tax reform and operations. With looking down the pike we've got C-band spectrum potentially coming to market, millimeter wave spectrum coming to market. What are the limits and the parameters around the balance sheet that inform what you are willing to do on the spectrum from so that we can kind of anticipate where the balance sheet looks like in the next 12 months? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, David. So on the voluntary separation program the way that I would suggest you think about it is - it's part of our overall business excellence initiative whether that be the adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, some of the other things that we have done. Really what we are looking at is while we are certainly glad to see the financial performance we have today and made good progress there what Hans and I are focused on is making sure that we are not just successful today but we can be successful into the future as well. And that we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along in the marketplace. So what this really is about is saying do we have the - if you were setting up our business from scratch today would you set it up the way it is? And there are significant process improvements that we have around us. And so the voluntary separation program is part of continuing to evolve and transform the way we do business to continue to improve the efficiencies across the business and we will be driving those changes over the course of the next 12 months. In terms of the size of the impact of it - it is too soon to tell. We are in the middle of the period where employees can choose to accept the offer. So in terms of the size of the initial charge that will come through in fourth quarter or the size of the benefits that we will start to get in 2019 it is too soon to say. When we have information on that we will certainly look to share it with everyone. But this is just part of the continued drive to transform the business, to make sure that we are successful in the long run and have the right cost base to be able to compete irrespective of how the industry develops. On the balance sheet, certainly glad to see the progress we've made this year. Strong cash flow certainly helped by tax reform, but also the operation of the business driving a lot of that benefit. So, you have seen the leverage come down from 2.6 times at the start of the year to 2.4 times now, and so glad to see that progress there. I'm not going to get into specifics about parameters about what we may or may not do around any type of acquisition whether that be spectrum or anything else. The key for us is making sure that we have a balance sheet that gives us the flexible structure to take advantage of whatever comes up. So if you kind of think across those two questions you had, we'll make sure we got the cost structure that we can take advantage of opportunities that come along. And then we've got the balance sheet flexibility to make sure we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along. And then we've got the balance sheet flexibility to make sure we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along. So we can be very adaptable no matter how the industry develops going forward and the opportunities that come up.\\nDavid Barden: Thanks, Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead with your question.\\nPhilip Cusick: Hey, Matt. Thanks. First, wireline margins were pretty stable, but you talked about continued pressure. How do you think about that from here? Is your comment of about 20% from the last call still a good level or should we expect some degradation? And then second, you called out a $0.27 to $0.31 tailwind from ASC 606 this year, and that that will fade to essentially zero in the next two years. As we think about the underlying growth in revenue and EBITDA driving earnings, do you think we can expect the Company to grow reported earnings in 2019 and 2020? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Phil. So, on wireline, yes, certainly expect to see the margins over the near term to be in that range we discussed on the last call around that 20% level. Would be a little above, a little below depending on the quarter. But certainly with the revenue trajectory in that business that will provide some pressure on that margin. So we are focused on continuing to address both the revenue trajectory and the cost side of the wireline business, but that's something we've been doing for a while and we'll keep working on it. As you talk about the impact of 606, and yeah, we still see about $0.27 to $0.31 of GAAP benefit this year. But when you back that out 3.1% EPS growth on an adjusted basis year-over-year and that's certainly what we are focused on doing. So as you think about next year, you really have to take this year's number back out the $0.27 to $0.31, put a growth rate on and then put around half-ish or so of this year's benefit in next year. And that will get you in around the right ballpark. But, net-net we are certainly focused on getting - showing growth at the EPS level and at the top line. But we just obviously got some noise from the accounting as we go over the next couple of years, and 606 flows its way all the way through our financials both for the current year and the prior year we are comparing to.\\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks, Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question please.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead with your question.\\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Two if I could. You have some commentary in there on the revenue growth or declines at Oath. Any commentary on the losses we got, have you in there for about less than $1 billion this year? Does the sort of I guess change in approach to Oath mean that you could find some cost savings there as well and maybe get that business closer to profitability as we look out to 2019 and 2020? And then more broadly on the 5G rollout the FCC passed some small cells citing reform. Does that change the sort of internal targets you have for the rollout of the small cell and 5G infrastructure and possibly allow you to go a little faster as you look out to 2019 and 2020? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks John. Yeah on the 5G rollout certainly we were glad to see the FCC rules around the small cell adoption, doesn't necessarily increase the velocity that we see. Our teams have been engaged with municipalities across the country on getting permits to put up small cells whether for 4G or 5G. Certainly like the fact that they are providing a little more guidance for how quickly that should happen. But I don't see it having a material impact to our build out plans. We are going as fast as we can. And while the federal level rules are helpful it is still a very local activity municipality-by-municipality. So a lot of good work going on there. On Oath from a profitability standpoint certainly as we said in the comments revenue not progressing quite as fast as we'd like, but from an EBITDA standpoint the team's made good progress on their synergy targets coming out of the closing on Yahoo over a year ago. The integration is now largely complete. We think we will have that substantially complete by the end of the year. So the cost side of that business is being managed well, and we just need the revenue side of the business to achieve its potential too and then we will be happy with what we are doing in the Oath business.\\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad we are ready for the next one please.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead with your question.\\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Good morning, guys. I guess just if I want to return to the question a couple of questions ago about growth. You've always said in the past that you can be something like a GDP grower. If I kind of step back from today's results what are the moving pieces that get this business back to being a GDP grower at some point?\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So Craig when you look at the results we posted today, I'm not sure we have to say what it would take to get back to that level. I think you are seeing growth in the business year to date both at the top line and the bottom line. And it is driven by largely by what's going on in the wireless business. When you have the best network and when we get it paired up with the right consumer offerings as we have and our wireless consumers can take advantage of that network and the way they want to do so you see the results we have. We see customers step up and as I said earlier we have still got significant runway in terms of the ability for customers to step up. So like the number of increasing connections we had during the quarter increase in ARPA as well, and we very focused on continuing that momentum. There is a high level of stability in the core of our business. So that's driving top-line growth as we reported this morning. And then as we also manage the cost side I think we will continue to have the opportunity to post good results.\\nCraig Moffett: If I could just follow-up I mean presumably just given the maturity of the industry with respect to penetration it's presumably an ARPU or ARPA story as you get to 5G. What kind of ARPU and ARPA growth do you think that you could eventually get to in this business, obviously barring any unforeseen big changes in competitive intensity.\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So we continue to look for new pockets of demand out there. You know, b0ut this maturity comment we've talked about for a long time now but we posted smartphone net adds of 510,000 during the quarter. So we are continuing to add to our base of customers. There is still a significant opportunity to do that. We have the opportunity to get a number of our customers stepped up from their current price plans. They often come in on a bucketed data device and then over time they step-up into unlimited. And we now have options there for customers to step-up to different levels of unlimited plans too. So we still have runway here in terms of developing the wireless business in the 4G world. And then before we know it we will be talking about transitioning the largest base of wireless customers in the industry over to 5G devices too. So I am certainly comfortable that our wireless business will continue to grow as we go forward.\\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead with your question\\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. You talked a bit about the cost cutting. And in the past I think the cadence you were looking for was an incremental $1 billion a year. So that would get you through a cumulative $10 billion over four years. You mentioned you are at $1.3 billion through nine months. So is there an opportunity to create even more cost savings over time than the $10 billion? Or is the $1.3 billion progress to-date just pulling from the future pulling forward some of those savings? And then secondly if you could just help us think about what the right cadence is over the next couple years in just broad cost-cutting terms? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Mike. So as we think about the cost cutting certainly glad to see the progress the teams have made this year. And as they have gone in and started looking at the business in different ways we are seeing lots of different opportunities show up. And now we are in the phase of really executing against a number of those. So certainly glad the progress we have made. Is there the opportunity to get more than $10 billion cumulatively over four years? We will wait and see. I am not good to provide any change to that number at this point in time but certainly we are being as aggressive as we can and making sure we are running as efficient a business as we possibly can and that will continue. In terms of the cadence of those savings over the four year period nothing really to update. I think we are still in the first year. And as you can imagine as you start a program like this there is a lot of energy upfront just deciding the things you want to do identifying the opportunities deciding how you are going to go after them. And so you are not necessarily turning them into savings immediately. So I think we've still got some good opportunity ahead of us from a cadence standpoint.\\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Okay, Brad, I think we are ready for the next one.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead with your question.\\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you for the taking the question. I wanted to ask about the public safety sector. Obviously with AT&T officially having FirstNet it seems in their advertising they are going hard after this sector which some have identified the TAM is as many as 9 million subs. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy there? Because you have exposure to hold onto these customers. What are you seeing in that? Are you seeing any early signs of churn or anything like that? Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: We continue to perform very well in that sector and it is built on years and years of strong partnerships, and we will be continuing to focus on that sector. Look, when you have large market share in many segments as we do, it provides opportunities for different people to decide to go attack them, whether it'd be in public sector with FirstNet or whether it'd be some of the things we've seen other competitors do over the past few years. I think we have been very effective at defending the market share that we have. It's based on building deep relationships with our customers, and builds on the reliability and the performance that they see on a consistent basis. So, we will continue to do that across all parts of our business, Jennifer, and it's really about just service execution. And when we do that on a consistent basis we typically win.\\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Okay. Brad, let's move to the next question please.\\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead with your question.\\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks a lot. Two questions if I may. The first is on CapEx. I think you have been pretty clear with us that we should not be expecting a surge in spending associated with 5G. I am wondering if that premise or how we should be measuring that surge from. Is that from where we began the year in 2018 with guidance or from where we are ending the year in 2018 with CapEx? And then secondly on churn, obviously great improvement over the past couple years although that improvement has reversed a little bit. I am wondering what you can tell us about what's happening with churn and what we can expect from here. Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Jeff. On CapEx, so really as you say no surge level. We'll give guidance for 2019 when we get into the New Year. We will be spending on 5G. You may not see a change in intensity, but we are spending on 5G today. We will continue to spend on 5G just as quickly as we can. But as we've talked about in the past, 5G uses a lot of the assets we already have in place. As we've been densifying the 4G network over the past three, four years now, we've been doing it with an eye also to pre-positioning the network for 5G. And we are seeing the benefit of that. As you see us roll out 5G and get the network ready to deploy and not seeing a massive surge in CapEx, and we've been pretty consistent on that messaging, and I think it's starting to show up. So, look, I think you'll see CapEx stay within reasonable bounds of what you've seen from us in the past. And we will continue to take advantage of the efficiencies in the network whether that is through the Intelligent Edge Network design, which will create efficiencies. Whether it's across the other things we're doing on the business excellent side I spoke about earlier. We will continue to look for ways to build the network that we want to build to provide the best customer experiences, but doing it at the lowest possible capital intensity. So, obviously we will talk more about the plans for 2019 in 90 days or so, but feel pretty good about the activity we have in the network as we complete 2018. From a churn standpoint you are right. We've seen good performance over the past, the past couple of years. And as I have mentioned, when you get the combination of the best network, which we've obviously had for a long time and when you get the customer proposition right as well, you get great results whether that's on net adds or whether that's on the churn side of the equation. And we've seen that now for over a year on the churn side. So look there is additional players in the marketplace today obviously with using the MVNO agreements and some other things. So we may see just a few points tick up there, but we'll continue to have very strong churn performance as we look forward here and expect to do so.\\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Jeff. Hey, Brad, let's move to next question please.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. You may go ahead with your question. Mr. McCormack you may need to check the mute button on your phone.\\nMike McCormack: Hey, guys sorry about that. Hey, Matt maybe just a quick comment on what appears to be a pretty good uptick in gross adds - gross phone adds on a year-over-year basis. Thinking about what the drivers might be there. Obviously last year you had introduced the unlimited plan earlier in the year so it seemed like you had maybe a tougher comp. Just trying to get a sense for whether we are seeing any prepaid migrations or anything else in the marketplace we should be aware of? And then on the Fios video side I guess no real surprise but yes downtick in sub losses there. Is that really just a function of lack of connects or are we seeing an uptick in churn on the Fios video site? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks Mike. So on the phone gross adds and you mentioned the comp in 3Q. And as I'm sure everyone recalls 3Q last year was when we saw the first sequential revenue growth in about three years. So as we came into this quarter we knew we were lapping a good quarter from a year ago. So to see the performance in wireless this quarter is certainly something that we are pleased about the way that the organization has performed in the marketplace. When you think about the phone gross adds, as I said it's really the combination of the great network experience. And when we went on unlimited people were concerned what was going to happen with the network experience. And we talked at the time that the network team had tested prepped for moving to unlimited. And all we have seen since we have been on unlimited is our network performance continue to improve. And in fact as we sit here in the second half of 2018, I think we are continuing to see us widen the lead and set the standard for the rest of the industry. So, that's part of it. And then you get the right offer out there. So we launched unlimited. And since we launched unlimited we have added other flavors to it. We see customers enjoying that experience and expect them to continue to do so. In terms of the prepaid-to-postpaid migration the thing I point your attention to is within the third quarter in our prepaid business we had smartphone net adds of positive 15,000. So while there certainly is some level of migration from prepaid to postpaid it's not driving the 510,000 smartphone net adds that we recorded in the quarter. So we are very happy with the performance that we saw there. And again comes back to combining the right network experience and the right customer proposition and good things happen at that point. On the Fios video side I think just what we are seeing here is - is you touched on is it's the secular trend. Whether it be cord-cutting or cord-nevers that certainly continues. What I am pleased about on the Fios side of the business is we saw Internet net adds of 54,000. That says there is strong demand for broadband. And as we have said before if you're going to rely on OTT for your video entertainment you want to make sure you have got a great broadband experience. And whether that be Fios broadband or now for those customers who can get in-home broadband through 5G. We believe we have the best in-home experience out there for those customers who want to get their entertainment from an OTT fashion. So we will continue to see pressure on the TV numbers, but I would expect us to continue to grow the broadband side of our Fios franchise.\\nMike McCormack: I am sorry Matt. Do you see an uptick in churn there or is it just less connects coming in on the video side?\\nMatthew Ellis: Well it's certainly less connects coming in and we see more new customers come in as broadband only. We still see a number come in as triple play. And the churn side, I think is part of the equation too. But I would start off with its less gross adds coming in upfront and us seeing more customers - the mix of new customers as broadband only versus traditional triple play.\\nMike McCormack: Great. Thanks Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Hey, Brad, I think we are going to take two more questions. So let's go to next one please. Brad, you with us?\\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. You may ask your question.\\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Hey, Matt the upgrade rate, the decline in it has really helped your cash EBITDA in recent years. Record low, it looks like 5%. Can you give us a sense on kind of how the fourth quarter has been going so far relative to the XR was launched? And even just looking into 2019, can you continue to expect a benefit to your cash EBITDA by lower and lower upgrade rates? And then my second question on the prepaid side, I mean, prepaid is obviously tiny relative to the overall business. Does it make sense to even maintain a prepaid product? And would you be interested in scaling up that through an acquisition if Sprint T-Mobile were required to make some divestitures or if TracFone was looking to sell that business? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Walt. So on the prepaid side, while certainly postpaid is the bigger part of our wireless business, we want to give customers the opportunity to experience the Verizon network however they want to come on board. So we value our prepaid customers. We certainly look to focus our prepaid business on the parts of that business that add value. And not all part of the prepaid segment does, so you have seen us change our approach there. You should expect us to look for ways to provide offerings to customers across the full spectrum of customers, whether that be prepaid, postpaid, or whatever. And we will continue to evolve the offerings there. But as you say, prepaid is certainly a small part of our business, but it is an important part of our business. And we will continue to evolve and adapt the product offering there over time. I'm not going to speculate on any other - anyone else's customers or so on. That is not what we are focused on. We are focused on our offerings and we will continue to do so. In terms of the upgrade rate decline, and while there has certainly been some benefit there, I would say the bigger benefit to cash flow has come from just the operational performance of the business. Certainly the lower upgrade rate has helped. I don't see that changing anytime soon. Certainly as we get into the fourth quarter, we would expect to see seasonal uptick in the upgrade rate. But whether it will be at the same levels we saw in the last couple of years or whether we will see a slight year-over-year decline, it's too soon in the season to tell. Obviously, we are not one month into the fourth quarter and the heavy part of the fourth quarter activity is still ahead of us. In terms of there are new devices out there, as you know, and they have been performing about as we had expected. And whether that be - you mentioned the Apple devices. And also the Google Pixel is a great device, a new device out there, and we are seeing very strong demand for that as well. So we will see where the upgrade rate comes out for the quarter as a whole. But I don't see a major change from the trends we've seen over the past couple of years.\\nWalter Piecyk: Great, thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Walt. Hey, Brad, I think we got time for one more.\\nOperator: Your last question will come from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead with your question.\\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick ones. One on enterprise, if you can share any color on how competitive intensity and pricing trends have been going in Enterprise of late whether there has been any change there. And then just go back to the question on Oath, are there monetization opportunities you would evaluate with Oath given the relative scale relative to some of the larger players in that space? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Matt. So, on Oath the team is focused on the right things. As I mentioned, they are driving demand in mobile and video offerings. And as I said, we have some great assets and talented people in there at this point. The business growth is not yet consistent with the quality of the assets of the people, but they are working hard and we believe they are going to get there. And that's what we are focused on, is supporting that team and the efforts they have. I would also point out the value that it's harder for people to see that came with the Oath business around some of the very strong technical skills, whether that'd be in data analytics, artificial intelligence, VR. And really taking those skills and deploying them across the totality of the Verizon business is providing significant value, too. On the Enterprise side, I would say no major change in the competitive intensity. We're certainly seeing businesses looking to do more, and change the connectivity profiles of their businesses, but we also are seeing pricing pressure in there as well. So what's going to determine our success there is if we continue to develop the products enterprises are looking for, not just for today, but for tomorrow. And as we continue to do that, that will be the determinant of our success in that space. The team is very focused on doing that. They've had a number of good wins this year. And if we keep on that trajectory, I think we have a chance to like where we will end up.\\nMatt Niknam: Thanks, Matt.\\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Matt. Hey, Brad, that's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt for some closing comments.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Brady. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. The 5G Era is here and we are positioning the Company for long-term growth by taking advantage of the full array of opportunities they have to offer. During the quarter, we again delivered solid financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities led by building the best networks creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model, and creating value for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for your time today.\\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using Verizon Conference Services.

LLC\\nOperator: Hello, and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is also being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\\nCraig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Our third quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and of course we will take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2.129 billion and with record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.01 and $0.99 respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by approximately $110 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.06. Sales were up 16% in U.S. dollars and up 17% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of 2017. From an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter increased 15%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business which comprised 5% of our sales was flat in U.S. dollars and up 4% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of last year. And our Interconnect business which comprised 95% of our sales was up 17% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $444 million for the third quarter. And operating margin was a record 20.9% in the third quarter of 2018, up 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2017 of 20.5%, and up 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018 of 20.6%. From a segment standpoint in the Cable segment, margins were 13.1%, which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2017. And in Interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.7% in the third quarter of 2018, which is compared to the third quarter of last year at 22.4%. This excellent performance is direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million, which is comparable to last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5% for the third quarter of 2018 compared to 26.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods excludes the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises as we have previously discussed. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 including the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises was approximately 23.8% compared to 21.8% in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was a strong 15% of sales in the third quarter of 2018. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 15% in the third quarter of this year to $1.01 from $0.88 in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted EPS which excludes the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods grew 19% to a record $0.99 in the third quarter of this year from $0.83 in the third quarter of 2017 which also excluded certain acquisition-related expenses. Orders for the quarter were a record $2.12 billion, a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $339 million in the quarter or approximately 110% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint; inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $1 billion respectively at the end of September. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 78 days, 73 days and 63 days respectively which were all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $339 million along with stock option proceeds of $72 million, short-term borrowings of $19 million, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $29 million net of translation were used primarily to repay a net amount of $194 million under our commercial paper programs, to fund net capital expenditures of $72 million, to fund dividend payments of $69 million, to purchase approximately $35 million of the company's stock, and to fund acquisitions of and dividends paid to non-controlling interests of $11 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 400,000 shares of stock at an average price of approximately $87 under the $2 billion three-year open-market stock repurchase plan. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. And at September 30, the company had issued approximately $338 million under its U.S. commercial paper program and approximately $513 million under its euro commercial paper program for a total outstanding balance under its commercial paper programs of $851 million. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Total debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.3 billion and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. In addition, as previously announced, the company had a successful European senior note issuance, in which the company issued a 10-year \\u20ac500 million note on October 8, which has an all-in effective tax rate of just under 2.1%. The company will use the proceeds to repay outstanding debt resulting in an aggregate pro forma balance of approximately $270 million outstanding under its commercial paper programs. The third quarter 2018 EBITDA was approximately $530 million. And from a financial perspective this was an excellent quarter. I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to offer my welcome to all of you here on the phone today, and we very much appreciate you spending some of your precious time with us. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the quarter. I'll then spend some time to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. And then, finally, I'll spend some time to comment on the outlook for the fourth quarter, which is, of course, also the full year of 2018. With respect to the third quarter, I could just say that I'm very pleased that the company, once again, reached new records of performance in the third quarter with sales and earnings both exceeding the high end of our guidance. Revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically to a new record $2.129 billion. And for the fourth quarter in a row, we booked a record level of orders, in this case, $2.120 billion, which represented still a very robust book-to-bill of 1:1. Operating margins in the quarter reached a new high, 20.9%. And that's just a clear demonstration of the strength of the company's operating performance, as Craig so eloquently detailed. And then, finally, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $0.99, growing a very strong 19% from prior year. I can only say that I'm just extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. I mean, their ability to respond to the many opportunities in the exciting global electronics market, all while driving excellent operating performance, is clearly reflected in the company's strong third quarter results. Now, turning to our progress across our served markets, I would just comment that our end market diversity, once again, was a great asset for the company here in the third quarter. With no market representing more than 20% of our sales, we remain very pleased by the breadth and balance of our end market position. I would just point out that this balance creates great benefits for Amphenol in any economic cycle. And very importantly, we're also pleased that we realized strong organic growth across nearly all of our end markets here in the third quarter. So turning, first, to the military market, the military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. And simply put, we had just another great quarter in the military market. Sales increased from prior year by a better-than-expected 22% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically. Our growth in military was really broad-based and included aircraft, military vehicle, helicopters, space, and communications segments, in particular. And sequentially, our sales rose by 2% in what is typically a seasonally softer summer quarter. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the fourth quarter to remain essentially at these robust levels. And for the full year 2018, we now expect to achieve sales growth in the high teens for the military market, a stronger outlook than we had coming into the quarter. 2018 has no doubt been an excellent year so far for our team working in the military market. They continue to successfully expand our position by driving our broad array of high technology products across the widest range of military applications. In addition, I'm very pleased with our team's ability to react to this increased level of demand from our customers, not always an easy task. And amidst this stronger overall defense spending environment, we look forward to continuing to leverage our high technology position to drive further out-performance into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically as we benefited from continued growth in jetliner volumes, as well as increased content on new airplane platforms. Sequentially, sales were slightly down from the second quarter on expected seasonality. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these levels. And for the full year 2018, we continue to expect a low double-digit increase from prior year. We remain encouraged by our strong performance in the commercial aviation market so far this year and look forward to continued progress going into the future. Our team working in the comm air market has successfully expanded the company's technology position across a wide array of next-generation commercial aircraft, thereby creating a great long-term opportunity for the company. The industrial market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 12% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically. And this growth was really driven by expansion in rail mass transit, medical, heavy equipment, battery and entertainment; again, quite broad-based. As we'd expected coming into the quarter, sales were down seasonally from the second quarter moderating by about 5% sequentially. And looking into the fourth quarter, while we expect sales to further moderate from these levels, we continue to expect mid-teens sales growth for the full year in the industrial market, a very strong performance. We remain confident in the long-term strength of our position in the industrial market. Through our organic product development efforts, together with our ongoing acquisition program, we've built a very robust and diversified suite of interconnect and sensor products for the widest array of industrial applications. As electronics continues to transform these industrial applications, we look forward to realizing the benefits of our excellent position in this important market into the future. Turning to the automotive market, the automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the automotive market were just a touch softer than expected, but still grew by a very strong 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically. Sequentially, sales moderated slightly from the second quarter. They were down by about 4% in U.S. dollars and just about 2% organically on a sequential basis. Looking into the fourth quarter, while we do expect sales to increase modestly from these levels, for the full year 2018, we now expect sales growth in the mid-teens, which while strong is slightly lower than our prior expectations. This reflects some small degree of moderation in demand from certain vehicle manufacturers, as well as their Tier 1 customers. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company's strong position in the global automotive market. Our team around the world continues to expand the company's range of high-technology, interconnect products, sensors and antennas for a wide array of applications within vehicles. These developments, together with our ongoing strategy of acquiring companies that offer complementary technologies, has positioned us strongly for the future as carmakers are integrating advanced electronics into fuel-powered, hybrid and electric vehicles. In addition, we continue to work aggressively with customers around the world on new advanced technologies. And these include next-generation emissions and drivetrain systems, autonomous and semiautonomous driving, as well as next-generation high-speed data interconnect, just to name a few. All of this creates a great long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales performance in mobile devices was much stronger than expected here in the quarter, as we were able to execute on increased customer demand for both new and existing programs. Sales rose by very strong 30% from prior year driven by higher sales of products incorporated into smartphones, together with strengthened performance related to laptops and wearables. Sales increased significantly from the second quarter rising by an impressive 72% sequentially. I just cannot emphasize enough how our team working in this extraordinarily dynamic mobile devices market was able to quickly ramp up in the face of higher than expected requirements from our customers. And thereby once again, demonstrating their outstanding agility and reactivity. Looking into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest increase in sales from these currently high levels. And in light of our significant outperformance in the third quarter as well as our more favorable view of the fourth quarter, and of course understanding as always the inherent volatility in the mobile devices market. We now expect sales for the full year 2018 to increase by somewhere approximating 30%. This compares to our prior guidance of mid to high teens sales growth, as we came out of the second quarter. Our team working in the mobile devices market continues to just do a fantastic job expanding our position in this exciting space. And while the mobile devices market is certainly not predictable, the agility of our team working in mobile devices continues to enable us to drive great success. Their reactivity in meeting the challenging and ever-changing demands from customers, all while continuing to develop innovative, next-generation products and manufacturing processes has secured our leading position in this important market. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits of this position for many years to come. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and we drove better performance than expected in the third quarter with sales growing by 12% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. Our growth this quarter was in particular led by stronger sales to mobile network equipment vendors. Sequentially, our sales were slightly lower than the second quarter due to the impact of normal seasonality which we had anticipated. While, we expect some modest reduction in sales from these levels into the fourth quarter, we now expect low double-digit sales growth for the full year 2018 which is a more favorable outlook than we had 90 days ago. We're encouraged by our performance in the third quarter, as well as by our improved full year outlook for the mobile networks market. And while we do not believe the strength is yet driven by significant investments in 5G networks, our position in the mobile networks market in those next-generation systems continues to strengthen. Our team remains focused on working to broaden our range of high-technology products sold into both equipment manufacturers and service providers as they prepare for the next generation of mobile network construction. As we look to the future, we look forward to realizing the benefits of these important efforts. Information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and our team working in IT datacom really drove excellent and stronger than expected performance in this market with sales growing by 18% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically from prior year, as well as 6% sequentially from the prior quarter. Our growth in the third quarter was broad-based across servers, storage and networking product and was supported by our sales to both equipment manufacturers as well as to the new generation of web service providers. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these high levels. But nevertheless, we now expect sales for the full year to grow in the low double digits from 2017 which is a more positive outlook than we had anticipated coming out of last quarter. Our position in the IT datacom market is as strong as ever, as we continue to extend our leadership in developing a wide array of next-generation products in high-speed, power and fiber-optics for a broad range of equipment manufacturers and web service providers around the world. As customers continue to accelerate data center performance, in order to manage what is clearly an explosive growth of online traffic, we remain confident that our high technology offering positions us strongly for the future. And finally, the broadband communications market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales reduced slightly from prior year by about 3% as cable operators continued to moderate their spending. On a sequential basis, sales were flat to the prior quarter which was a bit softer than we had expected coming into the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect a slight decrease in sales from these levels. And for the full year 2018, we continue to expect that our sales will be approximately at the same level as last year. Despite our relatively muted outlook for the year, we're still confident in the strength of our position in the broadband market and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our expanded product offering in support of customers who are delivering data, video and voice to consumers and businesses around the world. So just in summary and with respect to the third quarter, just simply put I'm extremely pleased with the company's strong results as the entire Amphenol organization continued to execute extraordinarily well in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. And Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages; our leading technology; our increasing position with customers across a very broad and diverse range of markets; our worldwide presence; a lean and flexible cost structure; a highly effective acquisition program; and then really most importantly, it's all on the basis of an agile and entrepreneurial management team. Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year, the overall demand environment no doubt remains strong. But nevertheless there are uncertainties in the global marketplace and in particular related to geopolitics and trade. So assuming no significant changes to the current economic and geopolitical environment and based on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 the following results. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $2.063 billion to $2.103 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.96 to $0.98. This represents a sales and adjusted diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 6% to 8% and 12% to 14% respectively. For the full year 2018, we now expect sales in the range of $8.040 billion to $8.080 billion together with adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.68 to $3.70. For the full year, this new guidance represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15% and 18% to 19% over 2017 levels respectively. But also note that, this outlook now represents full year organic sales growth of approximately 12%, and that's a significant increase from our prior organic growth guidance of 8% to 9%. So just in closing, I just want to say that, we're encouraged by the company's strong third quarter results as well as our strengthened outlook. And I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these great third quarter results by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position, while delivering superior financial performance in 2018 and beyond. And with that, operator, it'd be our pleasure to take any questions that there maybe.\\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answers period will now begin. Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\\nZiv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. This is Ziv Israel filling in for Wamsi. There have been a lot of concerns about China growth lately. What have you seen specifically that is \\u2013 are there positive or negative around China demand? Any color there will be helpful. And if you can put it in context of any prior China weakness you've seen that would be very helpful. Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you very much. Look I don't think we have seen any notable changes to the demand in Asia or in China. We have a very broad business on a global basis and we have a very broad and localized business as well in China. We have always prided ourselves on being a true local participant in the market. And that is part and parcel to the way that we're organized. Whether that is in North America, in Europe, in India, in China, wherever, we rely on local teams of entrepreneurial managers to run our business and that's really part of the real essence of the Amphenol culture. And how that manifests itself in places like China is just in a very positive fashion in that our team really is seen by Chinese customers, by global customers, as being not only a stable team, but one who truly understands the local market and can work on a level playing field with anybody else, including those local participants. If we look across the various markets, I would say that there haven't been anything notable in China. We haven't seen any notable slowdowns. There are always, in any given year, ups and downs, but we haven't seen anything that is markedly different than in other years.\\nZiv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. That's all I have.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\\nCraig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. Adam, so just in some of the more cyclical markets, be it industrial or automotive, you did point out that things slowed or weakened a little bit. Anything there in terms of just customers reacting to kind of slower growth or inventory, anything on autos and industrial you can point out?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I think autos and industrial, I wouldn't group them, Craig, necessarily into just one category. I think we came into the year with a certain outlook on industrial and we're still standing behind that outlook. We still see that market as a kind of a mid-teens growth market for the year, and I think our team has just done a really wonderful job in that space. I think automotive, I did point out that we've seen just really a slight change to the negative in terms of the outlook from customers. I mean, this has been broadly reported. I don't think we're going to say anything different than what has been broadly talked about, but this is just a general reflection of a little bit of reduction in demand outlook as we head into second half and as we head, in particular, into the fourth quarter. When we look at our performance in automotive, I would say that, on a regional basis, we've been a bit stronger in North America and Asia, maybe a little bit weaker in Europe. I don't think that that is much different than also a lot of the broad reporting about the overall trends in the market. But what is just really important from our perspective, you can have always volumes going up and volumes going down and demand for volumes going up and down for a wide variety of reasons. And again, I think you all know many of those reasons. But what is critical for us is there is not a change in that adoption and the pace of adoption of electronics into cars and into industrial equipment. We continue to see just an incredible array of opportunities to really expand our position \\u2013 irregardless of the overall trends, to expand our position long term by working with our customers on a very broad basis to enable new technologies; and, in the industrial market that's really with interconnect and sensors. In the automotive market, it's interconnect and sensors and antennas. And I think all of those trends that we in our company and others in the industry have benefited for such a long time; it's not that those trends are changing whatsoever. Now, I'm not going to be the one to try to give a prognosis about what volumes are going to be beyond here in the fourth quarter. There's lots of people who are much more expert than I am to do that. But what we clearly continue to see is the long-term trend of the adoption of electronics, the enhanced electronic functionality, new applications, new systems. That trend is certainly not changing or slowing down by any token.\\nCraig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Appreciate all the color there. And then, as my follow-up for mobile devices, I know there's a lot of attention placed on one particular customer, but just given the strength that you're seeing as I look at the mobile device market, and particularly China smartphones, that the high-end capabilities you're seeing today in those phones, can you give any context in terms of the significance of that in terms of the high-end of the market kind of broadening out? And is that something that might be helping you?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. It's a really good point, and I have talked for many, many years about this market under the context of the fact that we are choosy in this market in such as that we will participate where there is really technology being embedded in the hardware of the mobile devices. And that's been a topic for, I think, the whole decade that I have been CEO of this company, which is our mobile device is eventually just kind of empty hosts for software. And we've always said that we will participate in those mobile devices where our technology, our capabilities really have value for the customer. And that will come when there's really a premium put on the hardware. And I think what you are seeing on a broad basis around the world is that the phone manufacturers, the service providers, they all know that you cannot just sell these sort of commoditized empty hosts for software and have any differentiating capability. You've got to have features in the phones. You've got to have features in the tablets. You've got to have features in the laptops and the wearables and all those various things that are mobile devices. And those features have very complex requirements. They require an incredible degree of precision. They require an incredible capability, both in design and manufacturing. And so, when we see our team really driving the success that they have here, I think it is exactly in line with our long-term expectations that hardware will continue to have real meaning to the proposition that phone manufacturers and operators make to their customers. And so, whether that's in China or whether that's in other places around the world, I think you do see lots of attempts at differentiating through the hardware, through the functionality of the devices, and we're there to support that in every place possible. And so, I think that underlying trend of hardware, there's no doubt about it, still a very positive trend for the company. Look, all that being said, and I said it in my prepared remarks and I will say it always till I'm blue in the face, it's a volatile market. And it's one where you've got to be extraordinarily agile and reactive to the demand requirements of your customer. And if you can do that consistently, be reactive, be supportive when they need you, and if you can do that with enabling capabilities and technologies, then you have a pretty good long-term position in this space. And I think that's been our recipe, so far, and will continue to be our recipe going forward.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.\\nShawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC: Hi, morning and congrats \\u2013 or I guess, afternoon, sorry. Congratulations on the results. Two questions. First, just on the mobile networks business, continuing to see some strength there, was there any regional dynamics of stronger trends in the third quarter and now for the year relative to where you were 90 days ago? And then second, it's my topic de jure as of late, the lack of M&A activity in terms of just spend relative to your free cash flow. It lagged in 2017, you're lagging 2018 here year-to-date. Is there anything that's pressuring the activity other than just pure timing?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Shawn. I mean with respect to mobile networks, as you heard, we had a very strong quarter in mobile networks. I would say that the strength that we saw was more North America and Asia related and Europe was not so strong in wireless. So, it wasn't necessarily regionally balanced. It was balanced across Asia and North America, but not so balanced across Europe. But that is maybe not necessarily surprising given the overall trends in that space, but we were just really happy with how that came out. We hadn't expected coming into the quarter. I think coming into the year, in fact, when we started out this year, we didn't have such a favorable view of the mobile networks market. And I think our team has just done an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities that have presented themselves to us, while also doing the really hard work of making sure that we're well-positioned for the future, and in particular, for the future of whatever that next generation is 5G or otherwise. And so that's \\u2013 I think, the team has done just a really outstanding job here on really a global basis. Now, relative to M&A, I've said it many times. I mean we cannot control the timing of M&A. We continue to work very hard and we have an outstanding pipeline of M&A. But the fact that we didn't close any deals in the quarter should not be at all an indication of any change in appetite or change in strategy, change of approach, or change of opportunity. I would argue that 2017, we had a pretty good year in M&A. We bought quite a number of really good companies, understanding that as a percent of free cash flow it was maybe a little bit lower than the prior year, but in the prior year, we made the largest acquisition in the history of the company. So, I wouldn't read anything long-term into that and we continue to have a strong pipeline for M&A. And I will say that we continue to have just a very, very compelling proposition to those companies who really want to join and be a part of something great, to be a part of an organization that is extraordinarily hospitable to them as entrepreneurs, to be a part of a company that has just extraordinarily \\u2013 extraordinary breadth and reach from a customer and geographical and technology perspective. It's a very, very compelling proposition for companies when they're deciding to whom do they want to sell and where do they want their company to end up. We're not going to win every deal that we've said all along. We're going to remain very disciplined on price regardless of environment and we've said that when interest rates were low. We'll say that as interest rates go up. We've said that when stock valuations were high, when stock valuations were low. We've been very consistent about that that we take a long-term approach to acquisitions in a way where we say we're going to get to know them very, very well. We're going to buy companies on the basis of great people, great product and great position. We're going to be very patient through those processes. And when we buy them, they're going to be ours for life. And that's a very, very important principle. And I think, it's been a consistently successful principle in our acquisition program.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.\\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First question is on tariffs and Adam you spoke about tariffs last quarter and some of the steps Amphenol was taking to avoid or mitigate those issues. So I was wondering if you can provide an update on that topic both to what extent Amphenol has seen any direct impact on its own financial from tariffs and whether you think tariffs are having an impact at all on customer order patterns or demand?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, no question, Mark, appreciate that. Tariffs continue to be a thing. Unfortunately, it is what it is. I would just say that what I discussed last quarter in terms of our approach and our methodology to dealing with tariffs has not changed. And let me just remind everybody about that. I mean, first and foremost, tariffs are just a thing that happened. It's not something over which we have control. While we try to lend our voice very passionately to the debate about whether or not there should be tariffs, they are what they are. And so the question then is, how do you react to those tariffs? And what we have done in our company not surprisingly given our organization and how we choose to operate this company is, we've not taken a one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with the tariffs. We have really pushed down that decision-making to those \\u2013 to the general managers around the world who are implicated, who have to deal with those tariffs. And then those who operate at that level are the best equipped to know the logistics, the manufacturing processes, the supply chain. How those products are made? Where they're shipped to? Who are the customers? And ultimately, who are the competitors? And thereby make wise and real-time decisions about the measures that one can take to mitigate. And there are really countless measures that one can take in this event, whether that is changing the location of manufacturing, changing where value is created, changing how things are flowing into what countries, or of course, adjusting price, which we do with a heavy heart to our customers, but which you must do sometimes. And I think that the combination of those very operation part-number-by-part-number specific initiatives has ultimately resulted in the third quarter when we had quite a lot of tariffs that we had to deal with in the company really not having any meaningful impact from those tariffs. And I think, when you see ultimately the operating margins of the company 20.9%, I mean, that is also a reflection of the fact that these tariffs did not have any meaningful damage to our financial position. Now there's new tariffs every day. There's more tariffs to deal with here in the fourth quarter and I'm sure there will be more next year. And one day hopefully this whole thing will get resolved. But right now, we're managing it because it is what it is. And so, as we move forward, if there are new tariffs, if there are new levels of tariffs, I'm confident that our team is going to work extremely hard in that same methodology, ultimately to make sure that Amphenol as a corporation is not harmed by what I consider relatively misguided policies.\\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And a follow-up question on the IT datacom market which has been reporting stronger results than the company had anticipated at the start of the year. Can you help deconstruct that a bit more between the piece for hyperscale and the piece tied to more traditional OEMs? And I'm curious, if hyperscale is now a big enough portion that you could help us better understand what percentage of IT datacom business is tied to hyperscale at this point.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I don't have a number for you in terms of what percentage it is. But it has continued to grow at a faster pace than the rest, but I would tell you still it's smaller by some significance to our sales to equipment manufacturers. I think we've seen very broad-based growth in the IT datacom market in particular here in the third quarter. We saw really growth across all the different types of products. So whether that's storage, server, networking. I mean, those were all very strong double-digit growth in the quarter. And I wouldn't say that there was really a concentration of that into one or another type of customer, one or another region. It was very, very broad-based. And why is that? I mean, we certainly see, as I alluded to in my prepared remarks that, the degree of technology advantage that we have developed over a number of years and that included both acquisitions that we made, our own organic product development. The breadth of product offering that we have and the depth of that offering, all the products across the price-performance curve allows us and enables us to really be a strong, and really leading partner with our customers regardless of whether they are making a carrier class router on one side, or a blade server, a rack server on the other side and everything in between. And so, it's the strength of that product technology, together with the breadth of what we're able to offer those customers that has ultimately allowed us to have that more balanced and broad-based strength in the IT datacom market. I think, we feel very good about that position because it comes really at a time when the demands put on IT hardware on a global basis continue to accelerate. Just you can't pick up a paper lately without seeing some new innovation, some new development that is generating amounts of data that you can't even imagine. I think, I saw a story this week about this sort of deep space telescope which apparently is going to generate in a year as much data as the whole Internet today occupies. And you think about this sort of exponential growth of data that is being created and things like that, things like autonomous driving, things like video on the Internet, and high-definition video. And I think the matching of our unique and proprietary technologies together with that accelerated data traffic is ultimately the story that results in these results.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open.\\nMatthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. Adam, you've done a good job by answering questions here and giving good color. One follow-up, just regarding your comments on the telecom and mobile network area, you talked about strength in really the non-5G areas and there's a lot of talk about ramping in the back half of next year into 2020 in terms of ramps. How are you seeing that play out in terms of how you're positioned specifically with technology and customers?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Matt. Look, I don't \\u2013 I can't give you a timing of ramp of 5G, but what I can tell you is that our position is very strong. I mean, our team has been working for a number of years to make sure that our products are designed in on next-generation systems in the broadest sense possible. And if you think back about what is 5G from an equipment and a performance perspective. 5G is all about speed and latency. And to get really the levels of speed and the reductions in latency that are being really targeted from a 5G and to do that all at frequency sets that are much higher than current networks are operating which thereby requires much more density, I mean that's a lot of technology that gets embedded into these products. And the interconnect products that are used in those systems and are being designed into those systems just in certain cases have real step function performance requirements. And so I give a lot of credit to our organization, our engineers around the world who've worked with customers to make sure that our products are really front and center as they go through those design considerations. And look while you don't have a \\\"5G\\\" in the IT datacom space that we were just talking about with Mark's question, it's a very similar dynamic that you have to have really that leading product and that leading suite of products such that customers can rely upon your products to help their systems perform at these extremely high levels that everybody is hoping to achieve with 5G. When the timing is going to be and I can tell you we're involved in a lot of build-outs and systems and products where there may be what's called 5G ready, does that mean they are performing in 5G networks, probably not. But we already see customers producing equipment that is forwards compatible for 5G and things like that. So as usual in these generational changes in mobile networks there's a long lead up. There's a lot of test and validation, design work. And then the building out of that system, I think, starts to go slowly and eventually you'll have \\u2013 then have some meaning to the overall spending environment. But when that's going to be is a little bit hard for us to predict.\\nMatthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Fair enough, okay. Thanks a lot.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks so much, Matt.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. I have two questions as well, guys. I guess, first one, Adam, nice to see the upside you guys have on mobile devices. I think you said it was up 70% plus sequentially in September. When you think about what drove the upside versus what you guys thought it would be 90 days ago, do you think it's more driven by the fact that others that were involved in the same components couldn't execute the way they were supposed to, which I think has happened in the past? Or was it that end demand was just better in the products you're involved in?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think in this case, the demand was better and our ability to execute on the demand was a bit better than we had anticipated. If you just think about the mechanics and logistics of in a 90-day period having an increase in sales of 70% in a market, which is not so small on an absolute basis. I mean, there's a lot of hard work involved. And I just cannot credit enough our organization, who really made that happen. And when we say make it happen in Amphenol that has a real meaning to the people inside the Amphenol organization. And they really made it happen here. I mean, whether that is getting the production lines in place, getting the right people in place, getting the factories set-up, I mean, all the things that are required. And this is a team, where this is not their first rodeo, either, as you know, very well, Amit. I mean, this \\u2013 we're used to having these significant increases, but it doesn't make them any easier. It just makes you maybe a little bit more confident, in hindsight, that you can do it, again, when it comes around. But again, the simple answer to your question, I think, this was probably less us having to bail people out like we've done in the past and more the volumes being a little bit better and our ability to execute on those volumes being a little bit better on a broad basis.\\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And if I could follow-up, you guys obviously are seeing broad-based trends in September; sounds like it's going to continue in December. I heard your comments around tariffs. I'm just wondering, right, tariffs are supposed to go to 25% on January 1 for a lot of products. Is your response and tone (48:45) going to be any different at 10% tariff or 25% tariff? And then, importantly, why do you think customers are not double ordering at this point? If I know cost of connectors goes up by 25%, I might be better off buying more today versus waiting for January 1, and do you think that creates a risk for a bit of a vacuum in the first half of 2019?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, there's a lot in that, but let's just be a little specific about what tariffs and when. As you know, there've been three lists of tariffs. There was what was called List 1, List 2, and then List 3. And if you look at the products that are in those \\u2013 in List 1, there was a product line called connectors. So \\u2013 and that was already at 25%. So List 1 and 2 were at 25%. It was List 3 that has this sort of step one at 10%, and then the second step is 25%. Are customers kind of hoarding or overbuying, in that instance? We haven't seen that, necessarily. Could there be some on the margins? I suppose there could be some, but that's also constrained by just the ability to support those demands. And it's not that you have infinite capacity to support that pull in of demand. Obviously, we'll do whatever we can with our customers. And also bear in mind that the tariffs are due when the product moves into the U.S., which is not always necessarily when you sell it to the customer. And so, that dynamic that you described is just not as clear. And we haven't seen any real clear indications of that pulling forward. I think the bigger question around tariffs, and that's one that I'm really not well equipped to answer, is what ultimately is the effect of these tariffs? Where does it resolve? Does that ultimately have any macro economical effects? Does it have other effects? Those are all things that are probably above my pay grade to think about, or at least to make a forecast about. But I think how we deal with the 10%, how we deal with the 25% of that List 3, it's going to be the same way we've dealt with the tariffs that have come so far. And we've had significant products that have been susceptible to those tariffs. Again, not forgetting about the fact that, by and large, the vast majority of what we make we make and sell in the same region. And that's part of the strategy that we've always taken of being localized to our customers, and so we're not talking about an enormous proportion of our business here; far from that. But there is some that we have to deal with and I think we've dealt with it well so far, and our team will continue to fight like heck to do so regardless of what tariff levels come.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\\nDeepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Two quick questions from me. One is automotive risk. It looks like the organic growth came in a point or two below your expectations. Just curious how much of that was market versus content coming in softer versus expectations? And what's your comfort with continuing your strong high single-digit content growth performance, if the weakness continues well into next year?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I mean, one to two points organic, I guess, it's kind of hard for me to say is that market or content. But as I said earlier, we don't see any signs of content slowing down. I mean, far from it. We continue to see new electronic systems being adopted into cars. So I guess, without knowing exactly what the drivers of the one or two points of organic change, I would say that it's probably the market. And I think I said earlier that we continued to see \\u2013 have a very favorable view, long-term, towards the continued expansion of electronic content in cars around the world. And what the market will be, what the total value \\u2013 or total units of cars is going to be, that's much harder for us to predict. But I think we still feel comfortable that content is going to continue to grow.\\nDeepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. My follow-up is on semiconductor supply chain. Are you seeing any impacts from this well-broadcasted passive shortages, either directly or indirectly? And generally, has that headwind abated? Has that accelerated? I mean, just curious. I mean, it's something that seems to have hit a lot of companies this quarter? Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thank you. No, I think we've talked about that for a couple of quarters and it's a well reported \\u2013 as you correctly point out, it's a very well-reported discussion about, in particular, passives and, I guess, some semiconductors. We have not seen any meaningful impact on the demand of our customers due to these shortages that are so widely reported. I think we're still performing very strongly. On an absolute basis, our growth has probably accelerated over the course of the year, and I think that that's a sign that it hasn't been any real meaningful impact. Have our people spent a little bit more time because there are some of these passives and other assorted components that we once in a while buy for some of our more advanced products? Sure, our sourcing team around the world is working maybe a little bit of overtime to make sure that we don't have any impact on our supply to customers. But the sort of ancillary question of, are customers buying less from us, in general, because they can't get the matching component, while there may be an odd anecdote about that, I can't say that that's had any meaningful impact to the performance.\\nDeepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. If I can sneak just one more in, sorry. Your performance no way indicates that end markets have lost momentum broadly. But my question is what is the sentiment at your customer base that are buying your products? Has that moderated versus 90 days ago? I mean, obviously that's a big deviation from the weak market sentiment we're seeing. I mean just curious what your thoughts are there? And I'll pass it on. Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you. Look I don't think I would say anything different about the sentiment than is reflected in our guidance here for the fourth quarter, which I think continues to be a very strong guidance. I think our customers continue to be very positive, at least, the ones that I have interfaced with and I visit lots of customers on a very frequent basis. I think our customers are continuing to look for us to do the same thing that we've done in many cases, which is to deliver to them enabling technologies that helps them to get their systems to operate at higher levels. We've talked about that with IT, with mobile networks, but the same is true in military where we've done a fantastic job to both produce and design advanced technology products, but also to satisfy a level of demand that probably that industry hasn't seen for quite some time. We talked about that in automotive as well where customers while there's been some slight moderation in the overall demand that demand for new technologies has really not changed, so. And I could go through the markets, all of them, and all reflect on the fact that I think our customers are very positive about the future. Our customers are very thirsty for next-generation technologies. If there are short-term swings in demand that is what it is I think for some of them.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open.\\nJim Suva - Citi: Thanks very much. Adam and Craig, any comments on what you see for inventory levels, whether it be distribution, your customers across the supply chain, because we got to think that giving the tariffs as well as uncertainty and very strong or longer than normal lead-times, one has to wonder about excess inventory or double bookings and will that show itself in a positive manner now and catch up to us? Or simply are your lead-times smaller than say maybe semiconductor companies that have a longer lead-time? Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks very much Jim. I mean, as I've said before, we don't have perfect visibility into the warehouses of our customers. We do see the inventory levels of a good degree of our distribution channel and I think their inventories seem healthy, nothing really notable in our distributors. Look, with all the things that you very astutely pointed out, things like tariffs and the various lead-times and double bookings and all of that, I think a lot of those things are much more related to these passives and semiconductors that Deepa alluded to. Remember that our industry is a different industry and the way we run our company is, once again, a little bit different. It's not a capital-intensive industry and certainly the way that we run Amphenol is not in a capital-intensive fashion. Our ability to react and to adjust to changes in demand, be those on the upside which is a bit more fun, but also on the downside, is really a reflection of that agility that we have from manufacturing perspective. And owing to that agility, we're able to keep our lead-times relatively stable. There are some anecdotes that once in a while where lead-times will go out and I think we've maybe seen a little bit of lead-time stretch in the military market with the extraordinary increase in demand there. But by and large, the way that we operate and the way that the interconnect industry operates is very different from the semiconductor and the passives industry. And thus, I think you see a healthier supply chain behavior with respect to those things that you mentioned, like double booking and other items (59:11).\\nJim Suva - Citi: Thanks so much for the details.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks, Jim.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question in queue comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is now open.\\nTristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering how lean are your operations at this point in the cycle in terms of capacity and utilization rates. And if you have anything you would like to highlight in terms of CapEx spending going forward?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I would just say that we always operate in a very efficient fashion. I think I just \\u2013 when we just talked with Jim about inventory levels, I mentioned that from a capital spending it's not a capital-intensive business. The way that we operate our factories is a fast and flexible fashion. So from that perspective, we're always operating lean. And that's part and parcel to the Amphenol culture. It's not that we try to get ahead of things and build huge capacities and then wait for the orders to come and nor do we when times are good, burst at the seams and can't support our customers. So we try always to scale our operational infrastructure to the demands of the customers regardless of what cycle we're in. And I think when you look over a long time period at the performance of the company, especially during volatile economic times, you'll see that that reflects exactly that principle ultimately in the numbers.\\nCraig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: And the only thing, I guess, I would add on that is as you see this year we have had a little bit higher end of our range from a capital spending perspective. I mean, we have had pretty high levels of growth organically over the first three quarters and certainly guidance for the year here. And in those years while we do have a more significant growth, we certainly do spend a little bit more on capital. But again, it's typically within that kind of 2% to 4% and this year we'll be a little bit higher up into that range. But again, that's just driving those high level of growth that we have right now.\\nTristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then Adam based on your comments about China and tariffs, I guess, you're still likely to do M&A there in China, I think, with the current situation?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think I would answer it even more broadly, which is, we don't do M&A. We don't hunt for potential new family members in Amphenol in a way that is trying to chase the market, a hot market or run away from the market that has maybe lost favor in the electronics industry. We take a very, very long-term view towards acquisitions. Our criteria for acquisitions remains very consistent. I alluded to it earlier. We look for great people. We look for great products or in other words technology and we look for fantastic market position. And sometimes we'll make acquisitions when it's perceived to be the right time and sometimes we'll make acquisitions when it's not perceived to be the right time. And that's all part and parcel of a strategy that says we're buying these companies for the long-term, which is really for a permanent basis. We believe in Amphenol that when we make these acquisitions, we're getting married for life to those companies and to those organizations. And so whether you buy that in one quarter when that's the right place to be or in another quarter where it's not as much of the right place to be that for us is less important. So if the right company comes along, fabulous entrepreneurs, great products, great market position and that happens to be in China or that happens to be in a market space that is not necessarily the hottest space of the moment, we're not going to shy away from that. And along with that I will tell you, regardless, we're always going to be reasonable in terms of our valuation and disciplined in terms of the process of the acquisition. And I think that approach, which is really an approach that is agnostic to short-term variations in market trends and environments is one that has served us very well over the long term. Now, if there are governmental impediments that are put in place, very significant governmental impediments that are put in place, obviously we're not blind to that. And we would be very sensitive to that because any company that we buy, we want to make sure that there are not structural impediments to success. But I don't think we see that in any geography today of any significance.\\nOperator: Thank you. And speakers we show no further questions in queue at this time.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, that's very nice. And again, thank you all very much and we truly appreciate your time today and your interest in the company.

A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As a reminder, we have simplified how we report product and service revenue and customer markets. Starting this quarter, we are reporting revenue in the following five categories: networking, security, collaboration, observability, and services. And we are reporting customer markets in the following three categories: enterprise, public sector, and service provider and cloud. Also, as is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on forms 10-K which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Sami, and welcome to Cisco. I hope everyone is doing well, and thanks for joining us today. We delivered a solid start to fiscal 2024, with the strongest first quarter results in Cisco's history in terms of revenue and profitability. Our Q1 revenue was at the upper end of our guided range. EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by strength in gross margins and expense control, resulting in strong operating leverage. Our disciplined expense management and the tailwinds from our business model transformation resulted in our highest non-GAAP gross margin in over 17 years and record non-GAAP operating margin. We also returned $2.8 billion in Q1 via cash dividends and share repurchases, delivering on our capital return commitments to our shareholders. As we continue to transform our business towards more software and recurring revenue streams, fueled by accelerated innovation, we remain committed to driving operating leverage and shareholder returns. Now turning to the demand environment, after three quarters of exceptionally strong product delivery, our customers are now focused on installing and implementing these unprecedented levels of products. The bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Our order lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. As deliveries rose, the channel inventory we track at our distributors also steadily declined during this time. Simply put, customers are now taking time to onboard and deploy these heightened product deliveries. While the macro challenges we have discussed still exist, we believe this implementation phase is the primary reason for the slowdown in new orders. We saw it mostly with our larger enterprise, service provider, and cloud customers, and it was most pronounced in October. Based on our analysis, we believe this phase is temporary and estimate there is an additional one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders in customers' hands, still waiting to be deployed. This has near-term consequences for revenue and our outlook for the next couple of quarters, which Scott will discuss shortly. However, it does not change our longer-term confidence. We expect product order growth rates to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. We also remain very confident in the foundational strength of our business and future growth opportunities given the criticality of our technologies. Overall, our win rates are stable, cancellation and return rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, and we have gained market share, all of which are testaments to the strength of our portfolio and how it aligns to our customers' most pressing needs. As we look to enhance our capabilities in higher growth areas, in the first quarter of fiscal '24, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk. The combination of Cisco and Splunk will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency with our complementary capabilities in AI, security, and observability. The combination of Cisco and Splunk also directly supports our strategic objectives around driving higher levels of growth, software capabilities, and ARR. Together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership and outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. Now, let me comment on our quarterly performance. As I previously mentioned, we delivered strong revenues in Q1, which was broad-based across our product portfolio and driven by our customers' investments in generative AI, cloud, security and full stack observability. As expected, we continued to gain market share with the release of the calendar Q2 results, recording another quarter of year-over-year gains in three of our largest networking markets: campus switching, wireless LAN and SP routing. In webscale, we see continued momentum in AI, with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale ethernet AI fabric. We also already have line of sight to over $1 billion in orders for AI infrastructure from major cloud providers in fiscal year '25. To help advance AI, we are working with key GPU and storage partners to create solutions including ethernet technologies, GPU-enabled infrastructure, and joint tested and validated reference architectures with a commitment to open networking for AI. Collectively, we believe there is a great opportunity for a broad set of innovations and compute GPU networking software and services to support core and edge AI infrastructure. According to the 650 Group, the AI switching market is forecasted to exceed $10 billion in 2027. Our scalable fabric for AI, coupled with a proven power saving capabilities of Cisco Silicon One put us in a strong position to build-out the infrastructure needed for AI clusters and we are laser-focused on winning in this space. Moving to Security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap and strengthen our unified security platform. Since our Cisco XDR solution became available this summer, we have added recovery to the response process giving security teams the ability to snapshot and restore their business critical data at the first sign of a ransomware attack. With our three new offers around XDR, Cisco Secure Access and Multicloud Defense, we already have over $500 million in the pipeline across over 1,000 customers. We also launched our new Cisco security firewall solution this quarter. We are actively engaged in competitive sales with all these products and expect to see meaningful positive results in the coming quarters. In our Collaboration portfolio, we recently introduced a range of truly game changing AI capabilities, spanning the entire Webex suite as well as new devices for reimagined workspaces at our WebexOne event. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me briefly summarize three key takeaways. First, as we consider where we're at today, the primary issue with demand is that customers are taking time to onboard and deploy heightened product deliveries. While we were not immune to the macro, we believe this is temporary as our customers and partners continue to tell us that our portfolio is stronger than ever and we have continued to see share gains in key markets. Second, we remain confident in our future, with the incremental multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity, the increasing criticality of security and observability, and what we believe Cisco and Splunk can do together for our customers is truly exciting. Lastly, you can always count on us to take a disciplined approach, regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation, and expense management. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. We delivered solid results in Q1, driven by the prior strategic actions we took to mitigate the supply chain constraints. For the quarter, we reported strong revenue growth and a record non-GAAP operating margin. Total revenue was $14.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year, at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.5 billion, up 28%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.11, up 29%, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 9%; and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, drove the increase with 10% growth. Within networking, the growth was driven by switching, where campus and datacenter were both up double-digits on the strength of our Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000 offerings. This was partially offset by a decline in wireless. Security was up 4%, driven by our Zero Trust and threat intelligence, detection and response offerings. Collaboration was up 3% driven by growth in Calling and Contact Center, partially offset by a decline in Meetings. Observability was up 21%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress in our transformation to more recurring revenue based offerings. We saw solid performance in our ARR of $24.5 billion, which increased 5% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.4 billion, a 13% increase with software subscription revenue also up 13%. 85% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 10% to $6.5 billion, which represents 44% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 1 percentage point over last year. RPO was $34.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product RPO increased 14% and service RPO increased 11%. In total, short-term RPO was up 8% to $17.6 billion. Looking at our product orders by geographic segment, year-over-year, overall product orders declined 20% with the Americas down 19%, EMEA down 13% and APJC down 38%. In our customer markets, Service Provider & Cloud was down 38%, Enterprise was down 26%, and Public Sector was up slightly at 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.1%, up 410 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.5%, up 550 basis points. The increase was driven primarily by productivity improvements, with lower freight, logistics, and component costs. Favorable mix and positive pricing also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Services non-GAAP gross margin was 69%, up slightly. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 36.6%, up 480 basis points and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. This improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing disciplined cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.5 billion. We had operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.4 billion, down 40% primarily due to the $2.8 billion tax payment related to prior quarters, which was associated with the IRS tax relief due to the California floods. This quarter we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases, and growing our dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk, which we expect to close by the end of the third quarter of calendar year 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including approval by Splunk shareholders. In Q1, we also closed several acquisitions, all of which are highly complementary to our internal R&D in line with our strategy to strengthen our position in cloud, security, observability and AI with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter highlighted by topline growth and increased operating leverage that resulted in stronger than anticipated earnings per share. We continue to make progress in our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We remain focused on disciplined expense management without losing sight of the strategic investments necessary to innovate and capitalize on growth opportunities. Turning to our financial guidance, as Chuck outlined, the bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Most of the supply chain constraints are now behind us and both shipment lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. Q1 product orders declined 20% as our largest customers are implementing elevated levels of product shipments from prior quarters as we delivered orders from our historically high backlog levels. As Chuck mentioned, we believe there are one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders awaiting implementation by our customers. Our revenue guidance assumes, one quarter to two quarters of lower revenue and then a return to more typical sequential growth rates. Consequently, for Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82 to $0.84. For fiscal year 2024, our guidance is updated as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.8 billion to $55 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.87 to $3.93. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution this quarter. We remain confident in the strength of the business and our ability to capitalize on the key growth opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it back to Sami, so we can move into the Q&A.\\nSami Badri: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue-up for questions.\\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\\nSami Badri: Tal, you there?\\nTal Liani: Yes. Sorry. I was on mute. Now you can hear me. What is your assumption on the growth seasonality after the next quarter? Are we back in your assumptions to normal seasonality? Or do you expect kind of different seasonality than previous years?\\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Tal, it's a great question. As I said in -- well, we talked about one quarter to two quarters of basically inventory, but shipped product that's at our customers, it's not yet been installed. I expect the impact to be greatest in Q2 and in Q3. But when you look at the order growth, we do see a return to order growth in the second-half of the year, both sequentially and year-on year as we get there.\\nTal Liani: So in terms of revenue recognition, you expect 3Q to -- the 2Q to 3Q sequentials, that's -- that was my question. Do you expect 3Q to be weaker than previous seasonality? Or do you expect it to be the same as previous seasonality? Or even sequentially?\\nChuck Robbins: No, from a revenue standpoint, we don't guide bookings, Tal, but from a revenue standpoint, I do see sequential increase, Q2 to Q3.\\nTal Liani: Okay. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Tal.\\nChuck Robbins: Thank you, Tal.\\nSami Badri: Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead.\\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just a question on, if you see the investment categories kind of changing maybe free, the orders that you've seen, and then when do you see them come back in a couple of quarters. I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of have much of the orders we've seen over the last year been catch-up investments like campus and data center? And then areas of investment will change as we come back or is this really just inventory digestion and the investment categories and kind of investment prioritization will stay the same with customers? Thanks.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Meta, thanks for the question. I think your latter comment is probably the closest to the truth. We don't anticipate a big difference. Although, I think with the improvements that we've seen in our portfolio and security, we should see security accelerate. Obviously, we'll continue to update you on the AI opportunity that's out there. We think that's going to continue to be a driver over the next couple of years. But in general, I think it will look more normal once we get through this.\\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: Thank you, Meta. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Chuck, one of the things I think folks will struggle to understand is the conviction you have that this is an implementation pause and not a macro demand-centric weakness. So I'd love to just understand whatever you can talk about it and why you're so convinced this is a one-quarter to two-quarter implementation rather than enterprise demand is just getting weaker. Anything on that front would be helpful? And then, I just want to clarify the spot. You folks had $1 billion in AI orders that's two times the number you gave last time is that correct? Thank you.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Amit, thank you. So if you'll be patient with me, I'll give you a few data points and some context around why we think this -- this is a -- an inventory issue that's sitting with our customers. First of all, our customers and our sales organizations have been very clear with us over the last 90-days that this is the issue, particularly our large enterprise and our large -- and our service providers. We talked about that with the service providers prior, but it shifted into the enterprise space in a big way. The other thing is, we had our Partner Summit last week and some of our largest partners unsolicited began their conversations with me by talking about this very issue, which candidly I knew the customers had talked about it and our sales teams had talked about it. I was actually surprised to hear. It's so consistently at that Partner Summit. So, that's sort of the subjective view and then we've done some analysis and there's three things I'd point out. The first is, in certain parts of our portfolio, we actually can -- we can see the timeframe from shipment of a product until the product begins to connect to the cloud, back to the cloud like Meraki/And what we've seen is a one-quarter to two-quarter delay versus what historically you would see when these products get shipped, how long it takes for them to be activated and connect to the Meraki cloud. So that's the first piece. The second is, we had a very strong quarter in federal, U.S. federal, from an orders perspective. And so, we looked into why big customer like the U.S. government, Department of Defense, would not have the same issue. And the reality is, is that they have special clauses in their contracts that give them most favored nation status when we're actually making shipment decisions, and certainly with the Department of Defense, we prioritize them during the supply chain crisis. So they never had a big influx, they had a very steady flow of products across, which explains why their order numbers look fairly normal. The third point I'd say is that we noticed a serious uptick in Q1 in our Transactional Advanced Services, which is loosely translated to be implementation services, where that grew almost 20% and the forecast for Q2 is almost double-digits again. So it's clear that customers are asking us to come help them get this done. And I'll give you one final subjective data point and then I'll talk about the AI stuff. We had one big partner tell us that they will have literally hired 200 people in the last 90-days, solely focused on implementing technology for their customers. So there is just so many things that we've learned over the last 90-days. Clearly, this surprised us. But I think we feel pretty good right now. I'll make a comment about why I don't think it's macro, candidly it might have been easier for me to say it was macro. But as we've discussed prior, we have -- the traditional service provider has been tough and it remains that way. We've talked about elongated sales cycle, they remain. We've talked about, in some cases, the need for extra signatures, which is pretty normal, that's remained. But we didn't see it get materially worse in the quarter. And so all of that -- and I'm sorry for the long answer, but I wanted to be thorough, all of that is really what led us to believe this -- that this is a consumption issue with our customers. So I'm going to pause there, and then I'm going to answer your AI question. What we gave last time was orders to-date. We have taken orders for over $500 million. For infrastructure to support AI networks, AI GPUs inside the cloud players. Then -- and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. The numbers that we gave today is a forward-looking set of numbers. Let's say, in fiscal year \\u201825, which is when we said, we believe that the broad ethernet build-out would occur underneath GPUs. We have already seen -- we have line of sight to $1 billion plus of orders that our teams feel pretty good that we're going to get and/or we've been designed in already. So that's just sort of a forward-looking set of orders that we've identified for fiscal \\u201825, okay. I will also just cover real quickly, we are now -- we now have our ethernet fabric deployed underneath GPUs in three of the four Hyperscalers, major Hyperscalers in the United States. We also are working very closely with AMD, Intel and NVIDIA, to create solutions including ethernet technology's GPU-enabled infrastructure joint -- jointly tested and validated reference architectures. And I will say even this week, yesterday, Jensen from NVIDIA and four of his -- four, five of his executives came over to see us and we spent 90 minutes together with my executive team. And we believe we have a great opportunity to actually build some integrated solutions between our technology and their technology to actually take to the enterprise. So we're beginning to see the use cases in the enterprise evolve. And we think that partnership with NVIDIA, in that case, with our underlying technology and our strength of go to market, we think will be a winning combination. So we're working on that as well. So there's a lot going on in the AI space.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Amit. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead.\\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you'd be willing to unpack the networking segment a little bit in terms of the trends. And really what I'm trying to get at is, understand sort of what's doing better, what's doing worse, and in that I suspect it's datacenter bounced us pretty good whereas maybe campus is a bit weaker and declining. And that hopefully during this transition to the new segmentation, if you could give us a little bit more color within networking? Thank you.\\nChuck Robbins: Hey, Simon, thanks for that. I would say the bigger variance that we're seeing, I mean, right now, obviously the demand signal is little bit tough because of the amount of inventory that's out in the field and that we have normalized lead times at this point. We knew that would happen sometime in the first half. That's now happened. Our lead times are back to where they were pre-pandemic. And our backlog has shipped. The supply chain team has done a terrific job getting product out the door. That's what's kind of moved the bottleneck from our level down to our customers' level. But when you start to unpack within networking, we're not seeing at this point, a huge difference between, for example, datacenter or campus networking. But what we are seeing is a little more field-based inventory on wireless access points. That's been slightly slower than what we've seen. It just because of the amount of product that's been shipped out than what we've seen in the rest of the networking.\\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Simon.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Simon.\\nSami Badri: All right. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir.\\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about your share repurchase cadence. Stock obviously could get hit here. We have been talking about $5 billion in buybacks or so for the year. I know some of that stops that dilution. If you guys are confident in the second half pickup, is there any potential that you would be more aggressive in the upcoming quarter? And how are you thinking about share repo this year, given current dynamics with the Splunk deal coming? Thanks.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Ben, as we said on the Splunk transaction, it's going to be outside of the transactional costs. It's going to be cash flow positive from the first year forward. So the Splunk transaction is not, in any way, having an effect on our capital return, either through the dividend or through the -- through share buybacks. We expect to continue that higher level and consistent higher level of share buybacks, and to continue to show increases in our dividend. We also will obviously look at the opportunity -- at the chance to be opportunistic on the share buyback. I'm not going to commit to that at this moment, but that is something that we will obviously take a look at.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Ben.\\nBen Reitzes: Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, if I can just clarify one thing first. I think, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you did say, you saw the more pronounced impact on the orders in the month of October. I think that's what I heard you say. I mean, just curious, are you implying that you did see an improvement in orders in the sort of first couple of weeks of November itself and that's maybe part of your confidence in that? It's a bit more temporary than a longer pause from the customers? And then you did mention large partners really being the ones that are facing this sort of inventory installation problem. What gives you sort of color that SMB, the smaller customers sort of not going to face the similar issue or are you also baking that in, in terms of your sort of next couple of quarters of headwinds that you're thinking about on the revenue side? Thank you.\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Samik. I think my point with October was that if you go back to the end of Q4, we talked about on the last call that we had a fair amount of momentum as we exited the quarter, which is one of the reasons we didn't expect to see this. And we had our normal year-end sales, moving accounts around, moving territories around, and getting sort of the sales start-up process that happens in the first say six weeks of the fiscal year, which we went through. So what we tend to look for is the middle of the quarter. And then into October is when we expect to see, the actual quarter materialize and everything kind of come together, and it just didn't. And that's what -- that was the comment about that it was primarily -- we really -- it was really clear to us in October that -- that this was going to be the situation. Relative to they\\u2019re the ones who are having the consumption issue because they have the most inventory. You asked how we -- what confidence we have if it's not SMB, if you look at orders, we look at -- we look at a sub-segmentation within enterprise now, and within service provider, etc., and SMB was fine. And in fact, the smaller the customer we had, the better their order performance for us in the quarter was. So it just follow the trend that the consumption issue was upmarket and small to mid-sized customers didn't feel it.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Samik. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Scott, maybe this is for you. I just want to unpack maybe one of the comments that you made. And I know you don't guide to orders. But I think in your prepared remarks, you said backlog is back at normal levels at the end of the quarter. So, we do assume that the guide for Q2 and the rest of the year doesn't include backlog conversion into revenue? And then, if that's the case, to your comment about orders accelerating in the second half, I know you don't guide specifically to orders, but you did make a comment that revenue is going be up, I think, sequentially in the third quarter year-over-year and in the fourth quarter sequentially and year-over-year. Doesn't that suggest like a pretty steep order acceleration, not just an acceleration, but significant positive order trajectory in the fourth quarter and the third quarter? I know, it's easy comps. But just some more color there would be helpful. Thanks.\\nScott Herren: Yes. Yes, David, we did say that. I do. We are expecting sequential improvement in the second half of the year in both Q3 and in Q4. And in both -- and again, we don't guide this, but in both orders and revenue as you'd expect. Backlog is normalized at this point. We knew that would happen in the first half. I think supply chain team did a great job getting those orders in the hands of our customers. We would now need them to implement them, but we've got the orders in the hands of our customers. So we do see sequential increases. And as you said, as you noted from a bookings standpoint, our order standpoint, the second half has easier compare points. Obviously, the reverse is true on revenue and the second half revenue will have very difficult compare points than last year.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, David. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys, thank you for taking the question. Maybe just to dovetail one follow-up to the prior question, I have just another one on margins. Just on the prior one, is the expectation for a second-half improvement in a one-quarter to two-quarter digestion, does that vary at all across the three different customer sets you outlined? And then just on the margins, 36.6% on op income margins this quarter, I think the guide implies a 400 basis point to 500 basis point dip. Is that due to just the sheer revenue decline sequentially? Or are there other cost items we should consider on either the gross margin or OI margin line? Thanks.\\nScott Herren: Yes. To your second question, it is just based on how the revenues are flowing through the second half of the year. I think gross margins, we've said will settle in somewhere in this 65% to 66% range. I think at this point, it looks like it will be closer to the higher end of that range for the second part of the year. So that's the way I see the year flowing out. Remind me, Matt, what was the first part of your question.\\nMatt Niknam: Just around the expectation for second-half improvement in orders one quarter to two quarters worth of installation, is that broad across the three customer sets? Or does it vary across service provider, enterprise and federal?\\nScott Herren: Yes, right. I think, we expect -- I certainly would expect service provider to continue to be difficult through the second-half of the year. Within service provider, we've got both telco and cable, which has one set of market dynamics going on. I think that will be -- continue to be a difficult space. On the other side, we have web scale, and we do see the web scale orders while they've got also inventory to work their way through. We do see line of sight to them beginning to increase their orders again in the second half of the year. So, SP is a bit of a mixed bag, but I think it will continue to have probably the greater impact.\\nMatt Niknam: Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Matt. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\\nGeorge Notter: Hi. Thanks a lot, guys. Just continuing on, on that last question. If I look around the space, companies have been dealing with excess inventories for really three quarters now. And I guess, I'm just curious why is this now becoming more evident at Cisco versus a few quarters ago? And then also you mentioned that the issue is spreading more to enterprises. We don't typically think about enterprises is inventorying infrastructure. So I guess, the question for you is, has something changed there or is this more distribution channel inventory? Any insight would be great. Thanks.\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, George. I think that the reason it's become relevant now is because if -- I mean, we really unloaded our backlog in the last six months. I mean -- and it was billions of dollars more than what we would normally ship to customers during that time period. So they -- I think it's just -- and we know that the cloud providers, as an example, had been buying ahead and they had been doing it for sure to your point. And all along, we have very sequenced purchasing cycles with those players. So we kind of know when they are going to start placing their next orders. I think on the enterprise, we're talking about the top 200 customers, right. These are the big customers who actually -- if they're doing a refresh of their infrastructure, they might order 400, 500 switches, as an example. Or they may be doing a branch rollout. And in some cases, to your point, it could be sitting with them or they could have a partner who's doing the staging, and the partner may be backed up with resources to try to get the staging done. So it varies, but it could be a -- either one of those or a combination of both.\\nScott Herren: And George, just to put some data to that. And you have this data, but I'll repeat it. Our revenue growth, obviously, the quarter we're announcing now, product revenue growth was 9%. But if you go back to Q4, product revenue growth was 20%. And in Q3, it was 17%. So obviously, we get revenue when we can complete a shipment and get it out the door. It gives you a sense of just how much has been pushed out and as Chuck said in the last two or three quarters.\\nGeorge Notter: Alright. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: Thank you, George. And then Michelle, we have time for one last question.\\nOperator: Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, on the AI orders, $1 billion. What's the feedback from the hyperscalers on your improving position with these customers relative to a few years ago? Is it selling in a more disaggregated fashion with Silicon One? Is it a desire for silicon diversification? And then the second question just as a follow-up on the order slowdown. Was that more concentrated in the campus with wireless LAN and wired or data center or both, just within enterprise specifically?\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Michael. On the AI question relative to the cloud players, I think that -- look, I think early on, we regained our footing there because we listened and we showed flexibility with our willingness to disaggregate if they wanted to do so. And we're in -- I can't even remember, but numerous use cases across the large web scale players. And I think we added over 10 new use cases last quarter alone, where we had been designed in. And I think it's -- so I think that the disaggregation and the flexibility and us listening to them and understanding what they wanted was the reason that we got back in. And now the feedback is as long as we're performing, I think they like our products, they like the power savings of Silicon One. It's a massive power -- lower -- massively lower power consumption. I think they do like silicon diversity for sure. And then as you look at the AI infrastructure that's currently primarily being supported via InfiniBand, they just want to move to more of a standard broad-based technology like Ethernet that they can actually have multiple sources. And so we think that's what's driving that now. And now it's just about performing and executing and delivering on what we tell them we're going to do. Scott, do you want to take the second?\\nScott Herren: Yes. Michael, I think I touched on this earlier in the -- as the question came up. I think the way to think about it is, first of all, if you're trying to generalize the trend more broadly across the industry, it may be a little difficult because we've cleared our backlog, I think, significantly faster than others have. But where we saw a differentiation was less between big data center infrastructure and campus networking and more between networking and wireless. We did see -- because we've shipped an enormous amount of wireless access points out. We did see that take a little bit more of an impact just because it's -- our customers are sitting on more inventory on hand of that, that they're looking to get installed.\\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, Scott.\\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Michael, and all right. So we'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck, for some closing remarks.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thank you, Sami, and welcome again. Listen, we're proud of the team for the performance in Q1. Obviously, a very solid quarter with the exception of this demand issue that we talked about. We'll always try to be transparent with you and share with you exactly what we're seeing. We know what's going on. We're on top of it, and we do feel that it's temporary. At the same time, we're very confident in our opportunities long term. We're confident in the AI opportunity. We're very encouraged by our improving position in security, observability. And we're also very encouraged by the opportunities that will come with the Splunk acquisition. I think many of you know that on Monday night, the waiting period for review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. expired, meaning that we've effectively pass the antitrust review period in the United States. We're excited about that. At our Partner Summit last night -- or last week, the feedback on our portfolio right now was probably as good as it's been in a long time. And I also just want to reiterate our commitment to delivering value to you and our shareholders with the operating leverage, capital allocation and obviously managing our expenses in times when we see challenges like we have right now. So thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it back over to Sami.\\nSami Badri: Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 second quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 14, 2024 and at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.\\nOperator: And thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 1 (800) 834-5839. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial (203) 369-3351. This concludes today's call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our investor relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the third quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of $1.19 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to walk you through. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of $159 million primarily associated with the early debt redemption costs of $476 million; acquisition and integration-related charges of $137 million primarily pertaining to Oath; and a pension and benefit remeasurement credit of $454 million. The net impact after tax was approximately $120 million or $0.03 per share resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $1.22. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter up 3.1% compared to $0.98 a year ago. It has been three quarters since the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The effect of this change is illustrated within the table on slide 4. As a reminder, it results in a reduction of wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue and the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change has been fairly consistent during all three quarters of 2018 with a $0.06 per share impact in the third quarter. We continue to expect the accretive benefit to full year earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.31. The accretive benefit to operating income in 2018 is expected to moderate in 2019 and then become insignificant in 2020 as the timing impacts to revenues and commission costs converge. This will create year-over-year EPS pressure in both 2019 and 2020. For the remainder of this call, unless otherwise noted financial results will exclude the impact of this accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods. With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt to take you through the results for the quarter.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Brady, and welcome everyone to the first earnings call in the 5G era. Installations of 5Gs Home by Verizon, the world's first ever 5G commercial product, began earlier this month continuing our proud history of driving innovation. It is just the first service of many to come on this new and exciting technology. In the third quarter, we continued our strong operational and financial performance by executing on the fundamentals with laser focus while retaining and expanding our high-value customer relationships. Our methodical and disciplined capital allocation model affords us the flexibility to compete and win in the marketplace while investing in our best-in-class networks, strengthening the balance sheet, and returning value to shareholders. Also, during the quarter, our Board approved the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. Critical to our ongoing profitability is the work we are doing across our business excellence initiatives that are transforming all parts of our Company. In 2018, this has included adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, driving capital efficiencies from the network restructuring began last year, and more recently evolving our IT strategy and the announcement of the voluntary separation program. These initiatives are focused on positioning us to meet the rapidly evolving demands from our customers for years to come in a competitive environment. Let's move next to slide 6 to discuss our network and technology. During the quarter, we extended our leadership position, delivering the best network performance and overall experience to our valued customers. We won more J.D. Power awards than any other wireless provider for a record 21st time in a row and ranked highest in wireless network performance in all six regions of the U.S. In the most recent Nielsen report on streaming data quality, our reliable network ranks highest in video success ratings. And finally, we continue to extend our RootMetrics leadership position obtaining the highest percentage of wins nationally. While we are excited to be at the dawn of the 5G era, our 4G LTE network will continue to be a foundation of our services for many years to come. We continue to make enhancements to our 4G network through fiber and small cell densification as well as the deployment of new technologies to provide additional functionality and quality. 5G technology will provide meaningful value above the current network experience. At Verizon, we believe that true 5G requires an ultra-wideband solution, utilizing millimeterwave spectrum to address the full array of use cases that 5G enables. Our network preparation for nationwide 5G deployment requires deep fiber resources, a vast array of small cells, critical spectrum holdings and mobile edge computing capabilities. All of which we have been assembling for years. 5G Home by Verizon continues our legacy of consumer firsts. We are now providing wireless broadband service using millimeter wave spectrum. This revolutionary product offers customers a wireless in-home Internet experience with speeds and capacity that rival leading wide broadband products available today. The initial launch of 5G Home on proprietary standards in four markets positions us for a larger rollout in 2019. We are gaining valuable insights ahead of the industry that will drive refinements to the customer experience prior to the arrival of global standards-based equipment. We have said all along that we intend to be first not only in launching the world's initial 5G commercial product but also the first to deliver true 5G mobility to consumers. During the quarter, we completed the world's first end-to-end global standards compliant call with a smartphone test device using our network facilities in Minneapolis. As soon as devices and equipment are available the deployment of our 5G network on the global standard will begin for mobility and residential broadband in the new 5G ultra-wideband era. Let's turn to slide 7 and take a closer look at consolidated financial highlights of the quarter. On a reported basis third-quarter consolidated revenue was $32.6 billion up 2.8%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard total revenue was $32.5 billion up 2.6%. The primary driver of the increase was improved wireless service revenue due to customer step-ups to higher access plans and an increase in the average connections per account. On a consolidated basis excluding special items third-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% which was up from prior year's margin of 36.0%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.4 billion or 3.4% due primarily to wireless service revenue performance as well as continued improvement in operational efficiencies across the business. Our business excellence initiatives have produced cumulative cash savings of $1.3 billion year-to-date, from a mix of capital and operational expenditure activities. The program remains on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative savings for the four-year period. Let's now focus on cash flow results on slide 8. During the third quarter we continue to drive strong cash generation. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $26.2 billion an increase of $9.8 billion from the prior year. This was driven by strong operating results supplemented by the benefits from tax reform and the completion of the transition of device payment plan securitization to on-balance sheet financing. Year-to-date capital spending of $12.0 billion supported the increased demand on our industry-leading 4G network, the launch of 5G Home, earlier this month, significant fiber deployment in markets nationwide and pre-positioning for additional 5G services. We now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be between $16.6 billion and $17.0 billion. This reflects the benefits from our business excellence program which has allowed us to make all of the planned investments while aggressively advancing the 5G ecosystem and transforming our structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network. This architecture will provide both CapEx and OpEx efficiencies compared to the networks of the past. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $14.2 billion year-to-date. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility. We continue to maintain near-term maturities at low levels which give us confidence to operate through different financial market environments. We ended the quarter with $112.9 billion of total debt, which was comprised of $103.7 billion of unsecured debt and $9.2 billion of on-balance sheet securitizations. We have made good progress this year towards our goal of strengthening the balance sheet. Operational cash flows and the benefits from tax reform have resulted in a decrease in our total debt of $4.2 billion year-to-date while allowing us to make discretionary contributions of $1.7 billion to employee benefit programs. This has driven a change in the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA from 2.6 times to 2.4 times since the beginning of the year. Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments starting with wireless on slide 9. Total wireless operating revenue increased 6.1% to $22.9 billion in the third quarter primarily driven by strong trends in service and equipment revenue. Wireless service revenue increased by 2.6% driven primarily by customer step-ups to higher price plans and an increase in average connections per account. Our mix and match unlimited offering provides customization options to suit the individual needs of our customers while providing a superior network experience. In the third quarter, equipment revenue increased 13.7% on a year-over-year basis driven by higher-priced handsets and increased sales of wearables. Our postpaid customer migration to unsubsidized pricing has stabilized to 83% of our phone base. Comparatively, the same quarter in the prior year was 78%. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone base had an outstanding device payment plan at the end of the quarter consistent with the prior year. The combination of service revenue growth and efficiencies gained within the business have led to segment EBITDA growth of $664 million, an increase of 6.7% year-over-year. For the quarter wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.4%. Let's now turn to slide 10 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. In the third quarter, wireless operational performance sustained momentum from the previous quarters by expanding our relationships and subscriber experience with postpaid customers. Total net phone editions were 295,000 compared to 275,000 last year including postpaid smartphone net addition of 510,000. Postpaid net ads totaled 515,000 including tablet net losses of 80,000 and other connected device gains of 300,000 led by wearables.\\\\ Our postpaid phone churn of 0.80% is a result of our network quality and reliability coupled with the diversification and personalization of our unlimited offerings. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.04% was up compared to 0.97% in the prior year. We expect postpaid phone churn to increase seasonally through the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. Total postpaid device activations of which approximately 80% were phones were down 1.4%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.0% down from 5.5% in the prior year. In the third quarter, prepaid net additions declined by 96,000 compared to an increase of 139,000 in the prior year. Within this we had smartphone net additions of 15,000. The change in the size of our overall prepaid base reflects our ongoing activity to focus our prepaid offerings on value-added segments. Now, let's move to our wireline segment on slide 11. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.7% in the quarter as growth in our high-quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by technology shifts and ongoing secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition. Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.8% driven by legacy core declines and cord cutting partially offset by Fios broadband growth. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.1% due primarily to our broadband offerings. Fios broadband Internet experienced growth of 54,000 customers due to demand for high-quality Internet connectivity. Fios video results continue to be impacted by ongoing shifts away from linear video offerings with losses of 63,000 in the quarter. Our Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets revenues declined by 4.0%, 6.3% and 7.0% respectively. Enterprise Solutions revenues declined by 3.8% on a constant currency basis. Results in each of these businesses reflect the pressures on legacy products and price compression, which at this time continue to offset the growth in fiber-based products. Segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 19.9%. We expect price compression on legacy products, secular trends and increasing content costs to continue to put pressure on the wireline margins. Let's now move on to slide 12 to discuss our media and IoT businesses. For third quarter, Oath revenue was $1.8 billion, which was 6.9% below the same quarter last year. We are seeing revenue pressure from search and desktop usage, which is more than offsetting positive growth in mobile usage and video products, including our distribution partnership with the NFL. Because search and desktop products make up the majority of the Oath business and we believe pressure in those sectors is likely to continue, we do not expect to meet our previous target of $10 billion of revenue by 2020. The leadership team at Oath is focused on returning to revenue growth by completing the integration of the legacy AOL and Yahoo! advertising platforms by year-end, implementing initiatives to realize synergies across all of our media assets and building services around our core content pillars of sports, news, finance and entertainment. Additionally, we are utilizing Oath's technical capabilities such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality across all of Verizon. In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $241 million. Total IoT revenue including Verizon Connect was up approximately 12% year-over-year. Let's now move to slide 13 to summarize our third quarter results. We remain focused on our strategy to invest in our networks while expanding our high quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance, while building momentum for our ultra-wideband 5G network. Our launch of the world's first commercial 5G product signals the beginning of an era that will transform the way people live and work. Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network enabling efficiencies throughout the core infrastructure and delivering flexibility to meet customer requirements at the edge of the network. We are excited about our current positioning in the marketplace our financial strength and the opportunities ahead of us. With that I will turn the call back to Brady, so we can get to your questions.\\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Matt. Brad we are now ready to take questions.\\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks and two if you don't mind. I just want to come back to CapEx and the lower outlook there, it sounds like you are certainly enjoying some efficiencies as a result of your cost savings program. I am wondering if there are any timing considerations. So for example are we in maybe a little bit of an air pocket as you ramp down the 4G spend but you haven't quite hit run rate on 5G? And then on ARPA you continue to see some strength there. I was hoping you could deconstruct that a little bit. How much of it is strong product level ARPU trends particularly in phones as people take unlimited? And to what extent is it being driven as more devices are attached to accounts? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks Brad. Good morning. So on CapEx you certainly see the benefit of our operational excellence activities we have been doing throughout the year. This really started a year ago when we reorganized the network organization and we are seeing the benefits of some changes and how we run that organization using new capacity utilization models, changes to our inventory management systems, adoption of procurement analytical tools and a whole host of other things. So this is activity that began last year. It is showing up this year. I will tell you we are getting everything done that we wanted to get done in 2018. We are just doing it more efficiently than we initially originally expected to. And I don't see - you used the word air pockets. I don't see an air pocket here. We have been pre-positioning the network for the transition from 4G to 5G for a number of years now. So we will get into obviously our views on 2019 and beyond when we talk again in January. But we've got everything done this year we expected to. And the team has done a great job of just doing it more efficiently so that will open up more opportunities for us as we go forward. On the ARPA side as you mentioned we've certainly seen some good increase this year and it's been largely coming from step-ups. We have been seeing an increase in connections per account. But as we get customers onto unlimited and they see the quality of the experience there and then they step up from one plan to another plan we have been seeing some good overall results in ARPA. I will tell you there is still a good amount of runway there as well. So excited with the momentum that we have in wireless at the moment and I think there is still some way to go with it.\\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brady, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead with your question.\\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot. Good morning. Matt. you talked about 5G quite a bit. I don't know if there is any early commentary that you can give us on the launches and what you are seeing so far. And then as we think about next year and I think you said you would accelerate that. What is the timeline looking at like in terms of getting the standards-based gear and in particular a path to having a self-installed solution for 5G Home? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Simon. So, yeah, as you say we're excited that we are now in the 5G era. I will add that we started doing installs earlier this month. And we've seen performance as we've expected since we started doing those installs. The technology works, our customers are getting the experience they expected and we are getting a lot of good learning which will benefit us next year when we roll-out the product to that much larger audience. 5G Home will become more significant as we expand coverage and we get on the global standards equipment in 2019. And I would expect that that would start to have an impact on consolidated revenues as we get into 2020 and beyond. And you mentioned self-installs. A big part of what we are learning in these four markets is that install process. So when we get to rolling out across a broader geography on the global standard next year, we will just have a level of learning about the customer experience that will differentiate us from everyone else.\\nSimon Flannery: Okay. So is that sort of mid-2019 that we start to see this gear coming on in scale?\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, we are really dependent on the industry to develop it. We will be ready to deploy both on the network side and the customer side when the equipment is ready whether that be from the network OEMs or the customer equipment manufacturers. So sometime in 2019, we will push the industry to get there as quickly as possible and we will see how soon that happens.\\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead with your question.\\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Matt, could you kind of elaborate a little on the voluntary separation program. You know what the goal is? What the timetable is and what the margin impact is expected to be? And where we see that across the wireline and wireless organizations? And then the second question is with respect to delevering you've had good success there on the back of the cash flow windfall from tax reform and operations. With looking down the pike we've got C-band spectrum potentially coming to market, millimeter wave spectrum coming to market. What are the limits and the parameters around the balance sheet that inform what you are willing to do on the spectrum from so that we can kind of anticipate where the balance sheet looks like in the next 12 months? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, David. So on the voluntary separation program the way that I would suggest you think about it is - it's part of our overall business excellence initiative whether that be the adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, some of the other things that we have done. Really what we are looking at is while we are certainly glad to see the financial performance we have today and made good progress there what Hans and I are focused on is making sure that we are not just successful today but we can be successful into the future as well. And that we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along in the marketplace. So what this really is about is saying do we have the - if you were setting up our business from scratch today would you set it up the way it is? And there are significant process improvements that we have around us. And so the voluntary separation program is part of continuing to evolve and transform the way we do business to continue to improve the efficiencies across the business and we will be driving those changes over the course of the next 12 months. In terms of the size of the impact of it - it is too soon to tell. We are in the middle of the period where employees can choose to accept the offer. So in terms of the size of the initial charge that will come through in fourth quarter or the size of the benefits that we will start to get in 2019 it is too soon to say. When we have information on that we will certainly look to share it with everyone. But this is just part of the continued drive to transform the business, to make sure that we are successful in the long run and have the right cost base to be able to compete irrespective of how the industry develops. On the balance sheet, certainly glad to see the progress we've made this year. Strong cash flow certainly helped by tax reform, but also the operation of the business driving a lot of that benefit. So, you have seen the leverage come down from 2.6 times at the start of the year to 2.4 times now, and so glad to see that progress there. I'm not going to get into specifics about parameters about what we may or may not do around any type of acquisition whether that be spectrum or anything else. The key for us is making sure that we have a balance sheet that gives us the flexible structure to take advantage of whatever comes up. So if you kind of think across those two questions you had, we'll make sure we got the cost structure that we can take advantage of opportunities that come along. And then we've got the balance sheet flexibility to make sure we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along. And then we've got the balance sheet flexibility to make sure we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along. So we can be very adaptable no matter how the industry develops going forward and the opportunities that come up.\\nDavid Barden: Thanks, Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead with your question.\\nPhilip Cusick: Hey, Matt. Thanks. First, wireline margins were pretty stable, but you talked about continued pressure. How do you think about that from here? Is your comment of about 20% from the last call still a good level or should we expect some degradation? And then second, you called out a $0.27 to $0.31 tailwind from ASC 606 this year, and that that will fade to essentially zero in the next two years. As we think about the underlying growth in revenue and EBITDA driving earnings, do you think we can expect the Company to grow reported earnings in 2019 and 2020? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Phil. So, on wireline, yes, certainly expect to see the margins over the near term to be in that range we discussed on the last call around that 20% level. Would be a little above, a little below depending on the quarter. But certainly with the revenue trajectory in that business that will provide some pressure on that margin. So we are focused on continuing to address both the revenue trajectory and the cost side of the wireline business, but that's something we've been doing for a while and we'll keep working on it. As you talk about the impact of 606, and yeah, we still see about $0.27 to $0.31 of GAAP benefit this year. But when you back that out 3.1% EPS growth on an adjusted basis year-over-year and that's certainly what we are focused on doing. So as you think about next year, you really have to take this year's number back out the $0.27 to $0.31, put a growth rate on and then put around half-ish or so of this year's benefit in next year. And that will get you in around the right ballpark. But, net-net we are certainly focused on getting - showing growth at the EPS level and at the top line. But we just obviously got some noise from the accounting as we go over the next couple of years, and 606 flows its way all the way through our financials both for the current year and the prior year we are comparing to.\\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks, Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question please.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead with your question.\\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Two if I could. You have some commentary in there on the revenue growth or declines at Oath. Any commentary on the losses we got, have you in there for about less than $1 billion this year? Does the sort of I guess change in approach to Oath mean that you could find some cost savings there as well and maybe get that business closer to profitability as we look out to 2019 and 2020? And then more broadly on the 5G rollout the FCC passed some small cells citing reform. Does that change the sort of internal targets you have for the rollout of the small cell and 5G infrastructure and possibly allow you to go a little faster as you look out to 2019 and 2020? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks John. Yeah on the 5G rollout certainly we were glad to see the FCC rules around the small cell adoption, doesn't necessarily increase the velocity that we see. Our teams have been engaged with municipalities across the country on getting permits to put up small cells whether for 4G or 5G. Certainly like the fact that they are providing a little more guidance for how quickly that should happen. But I don't see it having a material impact to our build out plans. We are going as fast as we can. And while the federal level rules are helpful it is still a very local activity municipality-by-municipality. So a lot of good work going on there. On Oath from a profitability standpoint certainly as we said in the comments revenue not progressing quite as fast as we'd like, but from an EBITDA standpoint the team's made good progress on their synergy targets coming out of the closing on Yahoo over a year ago. The integration is now largely complete. We think we will have that substantially complete by the end of the year. So the cost side of that business is being managed well, and we just need the revenue side of the business to achieve its potential too and then we will be happy with what we are doing in the Oath business.\\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad we are ready for the next one please.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead with your question.\\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Good morning, guys. I guess just if I want to return to the question a couple of questions ago about growth. You've always said in the past that you can be something like a GDP grower. If I kind of step back from today's results what are the moving pieces that get this business back to being a GDP grower at some point?\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So Craig when you look at the results we posted today, I'm not sure we have to say what it would take to get back to that level. I think you are seeing growth in the business year to date both at the top line and the bottom line. And it is driven by largely by what's going on in the wireless business. When you have the best network and when we get it paired up with the right consumer offerings as we have and our wireless consumers can take advantage of that network and the way they want to do so you see the results we have. We see customers step up and as I said earlier we have still got significant runway in terms of the ability for customers to step up. So like the number of increasing connections we had during the quarter increase in ARPA as well, and we very focused on continuing that momentum. There is a high level of stability in the core of our business. So that's driving top-line growth as we reported this morning. And then as we also manage the cost side I think we will continue to have the opportunity to post good results.\\nCraig Moffett: If I could just follow-up I mean presumably just given the maturity of the industry with respect to penetration it's presumably an ARPU or ARPA story as you get to 5G. What kind of ARPU and ARPA growth do you think that you could eventually get to in this business, obviously barring any unforeseen big changes in competitive intensity.\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So we continue to look for new pockets of demand out there. You know, b0ut this maturity comment we've talked about for a long time now but we posted smartphone net adds of 510,000 during the quarter. So we are continuing to add to our base of customers. There is still a significant opportunity to do that. We have the opportunity to get a number of our customers stepped up from their current price plans. They often come in on a bucketed data device and then over time they step-up into unlimited. And we now have options there for customers to step-up to different levels of unlimited plans too. So we still have runway here in terms of developing the wireless business in the 4G world. And then before we know it we will be talking about transitioning the largest base of wireless customers in the industry over to 5G devices too. So I am certainly comfortable that our wireless business will continue to grow as we go forward.\\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead with your question\\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. You talked a bit about the cost cutting. And in the past I think the cadence you were looking for was an incremental $1 billion a year. So that would get you through a cumulative $10 billion over four years. You mentioned you are at $1.3 billion through nine months. So is there an opportunity to create even more cost savings over time than the $10 billion? Or is the $1.3 billion progress to-date just pulling from the future pulling forward some of those savings? And then secondly if you could just help us think about what the right cadence is over the next couple years in just broad cost-cutting terms? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Mike. So as we think about the cost cutting certainly glad to see the progress the teams have made this year. And as they have gone in and started looking at the business in different ways we are seeing lots of different opportunities show up. And now we are in the phase of really executing against a number of those. So certainly glad the progress we have made. Is there the opportunity to get more than $10 billion cumulatively over four years? We will wait and see. I am not good to provide any change to that number at this point in time but certainly we are being as aggressive as we can and making sure we are running as efficient a business as we possibly can and that will continue. In terms of the cadence of those savings over the four year period nothing really to update. I think we are still in the first year. And as you can imagine as you start a program like this there is a lot of energy upfront just deciding the things you want to do identifying the opportunities deciding how you are going to go after them. And so you are not necessarily turning them into savings immediately. So I think we've still got some good opportunity ahead of us from a cadence standpoint.\\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Okay, Brad, I think we are ready for the next one.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead with your question.\\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you for the taking the question. I wanted to ask about the public safety sector. Obviously with AT&T officially having FirstNet it seems in their advertising they are going hard after this sector which some have identified the TAM is as many as 9 million subs. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy there? Because you have exposure to hold onto these customers. What are you seeing in that? Are you seeing any early signs of churn or anything like that? Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: We continue to perform very well in that sector and it is built on years and years of strong partnerships, and we will be continuing to focus on that sector. Look, when you have large market share in many segments as we do, it provides opportunities for different people to decide to go attack them, whether it'd be in public sector with FirstNet or whether it'd be some of the things we've seen other competitors do over the past few years. I think we have been very effective at defending the market share that we have. It's based on building deep relationships with our customers, and builds on the reliability and the performance that they see on a consistent basis. So, we will continue to do that across all parts of our business, Jennifer, and it's really about just service execution. And when we do that on a consistent basis we typically win.\\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Okay. Brad, let's move to the next question please.\\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead with your question.\\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks a lot. Two questions if I may. The first is on CapEx. I think you have been pretty clear with us that we should not be expecting a surge in spending associated with 5G. I am wondering if that premise or how we should be measuring that surge from. Is that from where we began the year in 2018 with guidance or from where we are ending the year in 2018 with CapEx? And then secondly on churn, obviously great improvement over the past couple years although that improvement has reversed a little bit. I am wondering what you can tell us about what's happening with churn and what we can expect from here. Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Jeff. On CapEx, so really as you say no surge level. We'll give guidance for 2019 when we get into the New Year. We will be spending on 5G. You may not see a change in intensity, but we are spending on 5G today. We will continue to spend on 5G just as quickly as we can. But as we've talked about in the past, 5G uses a lot of the assets we already have in place. As we've been densifying the 4G network over the past three, four years now, we've been doing it with an eye also to pre-positioning the network for 5G. And we are seeing the benefit of that. As you see us roll out 5G and get the network ready to deploy and not seeing a massive surge in CapEx, and we've been pretty consistent on that messaging, and I think it's starting to show up. So, look, I think you'll see CapEx stay within reasonable bounds of what you've seen from us in the past. And we will continue to take advantage of the efficiencies in the network whether that is through the Intelligent Edge Network design, which will create efficiencies. Whether it's across the other things we're doing on the business excellent side I spoke about earlier. We will continue to look for ways to build the network that we want to build to provide the best customer experiences, but doing it at the lowest possible capital intensity. So, obviously we will talk more about the plans for 2019 in 90 days or so, but feel pretty good about the activity we have in the network as we complete 2018. From a churn standpoint you are right. We've seen good performance over the past, the past couple of years. And as I have mentioned, when you get the combination of the best network, which we've obviously had for a long time and when you get the customer proposition right as well, you get great results whether that's on net adds or whether that's on the churn side of the equation. And we've seen that now for over a year on the churn side. So look there is additional players in the marketplace today obviously with using the MVNO agreements and some other things. So we may see just a few points tick up there, but we'll continue to have very strong churn performance as we look forward here and expect to do so.\\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Jeff. Hey, Brad, let's move to next question please.\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. You may go ahead with your question. Mr. McCormack you may need to check the mute button on your phone.\\nMike McCormack: Hey, guys sorry about that. Hey, Matt maybe just a quick comment on what appears to be a pretty good uptick in gross adds - gross phone adds on a year-over-year basis. Thinking about what the drivers might be there. Obviously last year you had introduced the unlimited plan earlier in the year so it seemed like you had maybe a tougher comp. Just trying to get a sense for whether we are seeing any prepaid migrations or anything else in the marketplace we should be aware of? And then on the Fios video side I guess no real surprise but yes downtick in sub losses there. Is that really just a function of lack of connects or are we seeing an uptick in churn on the Fios video site? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks Mike. So on the phone gross adds and you mentioned the comp in 3Q. And as I'm sure everyone recalls 3Q last year was when we saw the first sequential revenue growth in about three years. So as we came into this quarter we knew we were lapping a good quarter from a year ago. So to see the performance in wireless this quarter is certainly something that we are pleased about the way that the organization has performed in the marketplace. When you think about the phone gross adds, as I said it's really the combination of the great network experience. And when we went on unlimited people were concerned what was going to happen with the network experience. And we talked at the time that the network team had tested prepped for moving to unlimited. And all we have seen since we have been on unlimited is our network performance continue to improve. And in fact as we sit here in the second half of 2018, I think we are continuing to see us widen the lead and set the standard for the rest of the industry. So, that's part of it. And then you get the right offer out there. So we launched unlimited. And since we launched unlimited we have added other flavors to it. We see customers enjoying that experience and expect them to continue to do so. In terms of the prepaid-to-postpaid migration the thing I point your attention to is within the third quarter in our prepaid business we had smartphone net adds of positive 15,000. So while there certainly is some level of migration from prepaid to postpaid it's not driving the 510,000 smartphone net adds that we recorded in the quarter. So we are very happy with the performance that we saw there. And again comes back to combining the right network experience and the right customer proposition and good things happen at that point. On the Fios video side I think just what we are seeing here is - is you touched on is it's the secular trend. Whether it be cord-cutting or cord-nevers that certainly continues. What I am pleased about on the Fios side of the business is we saw Internet net adds of 54,000. That says there is strong demand for broadband. And as we have said before if you're going to rely on OTT for your video entertainment you want to make sure you have got a great broadband experience. And whether that be Fios broadband or now for those customers who can get in-home broadband through 5G. We believe we have the best in-home experience out there for those customers who want to get their entertainment from an OTT fashion. So we will continue to see pressure on the TV numbers, but I would expect us to continue to grow the broadband side of our Fios franchise.\\nMike McCormack: I am sorry Matt. Do you see an uptick in churn there or is it just less connects coming in on the video side?\\nMatthew Ellis: Well it's certainly less connects coming in and we see more new customers come in as broadband only. We still see a number come in as triple play. And the churn side, I think is part of the equation too. But I would start off with its less gross adds coming in upfront and us seeing more customers - the mix of new customers as broadband only versus traditional triple play.\\nMike McCormack: Great. Thanks Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis: Hey, Brad, I think we are going to take two more questions. So let's go to next one please. Brad, you with us?\\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. You may ask your question.\\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Hey, Matt the upgrade rate, the decline in it has really helped your cash EBITDA in recent years. Record low, it looks like 5%. Can you give us a sense on kind of how the fourth quarter has been going so far relative to the XR was launched? And even just looking into 2019, can you continue to expect a benefit to your cash EBITDA by lower and lower upgrade rates? And then my second question on the prepaid side, I mean, prepaid is obviously tiny relative to the overall business. Does it make sense to even maintain a prepaid product? And would you be interested in scaling up that through an acquisition if Sprint T-Mobile were required to make some divestitures or if TracFone was looking to sell that business? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Walt. So on the prepaid side, while certainly postpaid is the bigger part of our wireless business, we want to give customers the opportunity to experience the Verizon network however they want to come on board. So we value our prepaid customers. We certainly look to focus our prepaid business on the parts of that business that add value. And not all part of the prepaid segment does, so you have seen us change our approach there. You should expect us to look for ways to provide offerings to customers across the full spectrum of customers, whether that be prepaid, postpaid, or whatever. And we will continue to evolve the offerings there. But as you say, prepaid is certainly a small part of our business, but it is an important part of our business. And we will continue to evolve and adapt the product offering there over time. I'm not going to speculate on any other - anyone else's customers or so on. That is not what we are focused on. We are focused on our offerings and we will continue to do so. In terms of the upgrade rate decline, and while there has certainly been some benefit there, I would say the bigger benefit to cash flow has come from just the operational performance of the business. Certainly the lower upgrade rate has helped. I don't see that changing anytime soon. Certainly as we get into the fourth quarter, we would expect to see seasonal uptick in the upgrade rate. But whether it will be at the same levels we saw in the last couple of years or whether we will see a slight year-over-year decline, it's too soon in the season to tell. Obviously, we are not one month into the fourth quarter and the heavy part of the fourth quarter activity is still ahead of us. In terms of there are new devices out there, as you know, and they have been performing about as we had expected. And whether that be - you mentioned the Apple devices. And also the Google Pixel is a great device, a new device out there, and we are seeing very strong demand for that as well. So we will see where the upgrade rate comes out for the quarter as a whole. But I don't see a major change from the trends we've seen over the past couple of years.\\nWalter Piecyk: Great, thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Walt. Hey, Brad, I think we got time for one more.\\nOperator: Your last question will come from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead with your question.\\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick ones. One on enterprise, if you can share any color on how competitive intensity and pricing trends have been going in Enterprise of late whether there has been any change there. And then just go back to the question on Oath, are there monetization opportunities you would evaluate with Oath given the relative scale relative to some of the larger players in that space? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Matt. So, on Oath the team is focused on the right things. As I mentioned, they are driving demand in mobile and video offerings. And as I said, we have some great assets and talented people in there at this point. The business growth is not yet consistent with the quality of the assets of the people, but they are working hard and we believe they are going to get there. And that's what we are focused on, is supporting that team and the efforts they have. I would also point out the value that it's harder for people to see that came with the Oath business around some of the very strong technical skills, whether that'd be in data analytics, artificial intelligence, VR. And really taking those skills and deploying them across the totality of the Verizon business is providing significant value, too. On the Enterprise side, I would say no major change in the competitive intensity. We're certainly seeing businesses looking to do more, and change the connectivity profiles of their businesses, but we also are seeing pricing pressure in there as well. So what's going to determine our success there is if we continue to develop the products enterprises are looking for, not just for today, but for tomorrow. And as we continue to do that, that will be the determinant of our success in that space. The team is very focused on doing that. They've had a number of good wins this year. And if we keep on that trajectory, I think we have a chance to like where we will end up.\\nMatt Niknam: Thanks, Matt.\\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Matt. Hey, Brad, that's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt for some closing comments.\\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Brady. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. The 5G Era is here and we are positioning the Company for long-term growth by taking advantage of the full array of opportunities they have to offer. During the quarter, we again delivered solid financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities led by building the best networks creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model, and creating value for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for your time today.\\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using Verizon Conference Services.

LLC\\nOperator: Hello, and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is also being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\\nCraig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Our third quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and of course we will take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2.129 billion and with record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.01 and $0.99 respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by approximately $110 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.06. Sales were up 16% in U.S. dollars and up 17% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of 2017. From an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter increased 15%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business which comprised 5% of our sales was flat in U.S. dollars and up 4% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of last year. And our Interconnect business which comprised 95% of our sales was up 17% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $444 million for the third quarter. And operating margin was a record 20.9% in the third quarter of 2018, up 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2017 of 20.5%, and up 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018 of 20.6%. From a segment standpoint in the Cable segment, margins were 13.1%, which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2017. And in Interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.7% in the third quarter of 2018, which is compared to the third quarter of last year at 22.4%. This excellent performance is direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million, which is comparable to last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5% for the third quarter of 2018 compared to 26.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods excludes the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises as we have previously discussed. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 including the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises was approximately 23.8% compared to 21.8% in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was a strong 15% of sales in the third quarter of 2018. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 15% in the third quarter of this year to $1.01 from $0.88 in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted EPS which excludes the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods grew 19% to a record $0.99 in the third quarter of this year from $0.83 in the third quarter of 2017 which also excluded certain acquisition-related expenses. Orders for the quarter were a record $2.12 billion, a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $339 million in the quarter or approximately 110% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint; inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $1 billion respectively at the end of September. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 78 days, 73 days and 63 days respectively which were all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $339 million along with stock option proceeds of $72 million, short-term borrowings of $19 million, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $29 million net of translation were used primarily to repay a net amount of $194 million under our commercial paper programs, to fund net capital expenditures of $72 million, to fund dividend payments of $69 million, to purchase approximately $35 million of the company's stock, and to fund acquisitions of and dividends paid to non-controlling interests of $11 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 400,000 shares of stock at an average price of approximately $87 under the $2 billion three-year open-market stock repurchase plan. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. And at September 30, the company had issued approximately $338 million under its U.S. commercial paper program and approximately $513 million under its euro commercial paper program for a total outstanding balance under its commercial paper programs of $851 million. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Total debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.3 billion and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. In addition, as previously announced, the company had a successful European senior note issuance, in which the company issued a 10-year \\u20ac500 million note on October 8, which has an all-in effective tax rate of just under 2.1%. The company will use the proceeds to repay outstanding debt resulting in an aggregate pro forma balance of approximately $270 million outstanding under its commercial paper programs. The third quarter 2018 EBITDA was approximately $530 million. And from a financial perspective this was an excellent quarter. I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to offer my welcome to all of you here on the phone today, and we very much appreciate you spending some of your precious time with us. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the quarter. I'll then spend some time to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. And then, finally, I'll spend some time to comment on the outlook for the fourth quarter, which is, of course, also the full year of 2018. With respect to the third quarter, I could just say that I'm very pleased that the company, once again, reached new records of performance in the third quarter with sales and earnings both exceeding the high end of our guidance. Revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically to a new record $2.129 billion. And for the fourth quarter in a row, we booked a record level of orders, in this case, $2.120 billion, which represented still a very robust book-to-bill of 1:1. Operating margins in the quarter reached a new high, 20.9%. And that's just a clear demonstration of the strength of the company's operating performance, as Craig so eloquently detailed. And then, finally, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $0.99, growing a very strong 19% from prior year. I can only say that I'm just extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. I mean, their ability to respond to the many opportunities in the exciting global electronics market, all while driving excellent operating performance, is clearly reflected in the company's strong third quarter results. Now, turning to our progress across our served markets, I would just comment that our end market diversity, once again, was a great asset for the company here in the third quarter. With no market representing more than 20% of our sales, we remain very pleased by the breadth and balance of our end market position. I would just point out that this balance creates great benefits for Amphenol in any economic cycle. And very importantly, we're also pleased that we realized strong organic growth across nearly all of our end markets here in the third quarter. So turning, first, to the military market, the military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. And simply put, we had just another great quarter in the military market. Sales increased from prior year by a better-than-expected 22% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically. Our growth in military was really broad-based and included aircraft, military vehicle, helicopters, space, and communications segments, in particular. And sequentially, our sales rose by 2% in what is typically a seasonally softer summer quarter. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the fourth quarter to remain essentially at these robust levels. And for the full year 2018, we now expect to achieve sales growth in the high teens for the military market, a stronger outlook than we had coming into the quarter. 2018 has no doubt been an excellent year so far for our team working in the military market. They continue to successfully expand our position by driving our broad array of high technology products across the widest range of military applications. In addition, I'm very pleased with our team's ability to react to this increased level of demand from our customers, not always an easy task. And amidst this stronger overall defense spending environment, we look forward to continuing to leverage our high technology position to drive further out-performance into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically as we benefited from continued growth in jetliner volumes, as well as increased content on new airplane platforms. Sequentially, sales were slightly down from the second quarter on expected seasonality. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these levels. And for the full year 2018, we continue to expect a low double-digit increase from prior year. We remain encouraged by our strong performance in the commercial aviation market so far this year and look forward to continued progress going into the future. Our team working in the comm air market has successfully expanded the company's technology position across a wide array of next-generation commercial aircraft, thereby creating a great long-term opportunity for the company. The industrial market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 12% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically. And this growth was really driven by expansion in rail mass transit, medical, heavy equipment, battery and entertainment; again, quite broad-based. As we'd expected coming into the quarter, sales were down seasonally from the second quarter moderating by about 5% sequentially. And looking into the fourth quarter, while we expect sales to further moderate from these levels, we continue to expect mid-teens sales growth for the full year in the industrial market, a very strong performance. We remain confident in the long-term strength of our position in the industrial market. Through our organic product development efforts, together with our ongoing acquisition program, we've built a very robust and diversified suite of interconnect and sensor products for the widest array of industrial applications. As electronics continues to transform these industrial applications, we look forward to realizing the benefits of our excellent position in this important market into the future. Turning to the automotive market, the automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the automotive market were just a touch softer than expected, but still grew by a very strong 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically. Sequentially, sales moderated slightly from the second quarter. They were down by about 4% in U.S. dollars and just about 2% organically on a sequential basis. Looking into the fourth quarter, while we do expect sales to increase modestly from these levels, for the full year 2018, we now expect sales growth in the mid-teens, which while strong is slightly lower than our prior expectations. This reflects some small degree of moderation in demand from certain vehicle manufacturers, as well as their Tier 1 customers. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company's strong position in the global automotive market. Our team around the world continues to expand the company's range of high-technology, interconnect products, sensors and antennas for a wide array of applications within vehicles. These developments, together with our ongoing strategy of acquiring companies that offer complementary technologies, has positioned us strongly for the future as carmakers are integrating advanced electronics into fuel-powered, hybrid and electric vehicles. In addition, we continue to work aggressively with customers around the world on new advanced technologies. And these include next-generation emissions and drivetrain systems, autonomous and semiautonomous driving, as well as next-generation high-speed data interconnect, just to name a few. All of this creates a great long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales performance in mobile devices was much stronger than expected here in the quarter, as we were able to execute on increased customer demand for both new and existing programs. Sales rose by very strong 30% from prior year driven by higher sales of products incorporated into smartphones, together with strengthened performance related to laptops and wearables. Sales increased significantly from the second quarter rising by an impressive 72% sequentially. I just cannot emphasize enough how our team working in this extraordinarily dynamic mobile devices market was able to quickly ramp up in the face of higher than expected requirements from our customers. And thereby once again, demonstrating their outstanding agility and reactivity. Looking into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest increase in sales from these currently high levels. And in light of our significant outperformance in the third quarter as well as our more favorable view of the fourth quarter, and of course understanding as always the inherent volatility in the mobile devices market. We now expect sales for the full year 2018 to increase by somewhere approximating 30%. This compares to our prior guidance of mid to high teens sales growth, as we came out of the second quarter. Our team working in the mobile devices market continues to just do a fantastic job expanding our position in this exciting space. And while the mobile devices market is certainly not predictable, the agility of our team working in mobile devices continues to enable us to drive great success. Their reactivity in meeting the challenging and ever-changing demands from customers, all while continuing to develop innovative, next-generation products and manufacturing processes has secured our leading position in this important market. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits of this position for many years to come. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and we drove better performance than expected in the third quarter with sales growing by 12% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. Our growth this quarter was in particular led by stronger sales to mobile network equipment vendors. Sequentially, our sales were slightly lower than the second quarter due to the impact of normal seasonality which we had anticipated. While, we expect some modest reduction in sales from these levels into the fourth quarter, we now expect low double-digit sales growth for the full year 2018 which is a more favorable outlook than we had 90 days ago. We're encouraged by our performance in the third quarter, as well as by our improved full year outlook for the mobile networks market. And while we do not believe the strength is yet driven by significant investments in 5G networks, our position in the mobile networks market in those next-generation systems continues to strengthen. Our team remains focused on working to broaden our range of high-technology products sold into both equipment manufacturers and service providers as they prepare for the next generation of mobile network construction. As we look to the future, we look forward to realizing the benefits of these important efforts. Information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and our team working in IT datacom really drove excellent and stronger than expected performance in this market with sales growing by 18% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically from prior year, as well as 6% sequentially from the prior quarter. Our growth in the third quarter was broad-based across servers, storage and networking product and was supported by our sales to both equipment manufacturers as well as to the new generation of web service providers. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these high levels. But nevertheless, we now expect sales for the full year to grow in the low double digits from 2017 which is a more positive outlook than we had anticipated coming out of last quarter. Our position in the IT datacom market is as strong as ever, as we continue to extend our leadership in developing a wide array of next-generation products in high-speed, power and fiber-optics for a broad range of equipment manufacturers and web service providers around the world. As customers continue to accelerate data center performance, in order to manage what is clearly an explosive growth of online traffic, we remain confident that our high technology offering positions us strongly for the future. And finally, the broadband communications market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales reduced slightly from prior year by about 3% as cable operators continued to moderate their spending. On a sequential basis, sales were flat to the prior quarter which was a bit softer than we had expected coming into the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect a slight decrease in sales from these levels. And for the full year 2018, we continue to expect that our sales will be approximately at the same level as last year. Despite our relatively muted outlook for the year, we're still confident in the strength of our position in the broadband market and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our expanded product offering in support of customers who are delivering data, video and voice to consumers and businesses around the world. So just in summary and with respect to the third quarter, just simply put I'm extremely pleased with the company's strong results as the entire Amphenol organization continued to execute extraordinarily well in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. And Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages; our leading technology; our increasing position with customers across a very broad and diverse range of markets; our worldwide presence; a lean and flexible cost structure; a highly effective acquisition program; and then really most importantly, it's all on the basis of an agile and entrepreneurial management team. Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year, the overall demand environment no doubt remains strong. But nevertheless there are uncertainties in the global marketplace and in particular related to geopolitics and trade. So assuming no significant changes to the current economic and geopolitical environment and based on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 the following results. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $2.063 billion to $2.103 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.96 to $0.98. This represents a sales and adjusted diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 6% to 8% and 12% to 14% respectively. For the full year 2018, we now expect sales in the range of $8.040 billion to $8.080 billion together with adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.68 to $3.70. For the full year, this new guidance represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15% and 18% to 19% over 2017 levels respectively. But also note that, this outlook now represents full year organic sales growth of approximately 12%, and that's a significant increase from our prior organic growth guidance of 8% to 9%. So just in closing, I just want to say that, we're encouraged by the company's strong third quarter results as well as our strengthened outlook. And I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these great third quarter results by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position, while delivering superior financial performance in 2018 and beyond. And with that, operator, it'd be our pleasure to take any questions that there maybe.\\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answers period will now begin. Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\\nZiv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. This is Ziv Israel filling in for Wamsi. There have been a lot of concerns about China growth lately. What have you seen specifically that is \\u2013 are there positive or negative around China demand? Any color there will be helpful. And if you can put it in context of any prior China weakness you've seen that would be very helpful. Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you very much. Look I don't think we have seen any notable changes to the demand in Asia or in China. We have a very broad business on a global basis and we have a very broad and localized business as well in China. We have always prided ourselves on being a true local participant in the market. And that is part and parcel to the way that we're organized. Whether that is in North America, in Europe, in India, in China, wherever, we rely on local teams of entrepreneurial managers to run our business and that's really part of the real essence of the Amphenol culture. And how that manifests itself in places like China is just in a very positive fashion in that our team really is seen by Chinese customers, by global customers, as being not only a stable team, but one who truly understands the local market and can work on a level playing field with anybody else, including those local participants. If we look across the various markets, I would say that there haven't been anything notable in China. We haven't seen any notable slowdowns. There are always, in any given year, ups and downs, but we haven't seen anything that is markedly different than in other years.\\nZiv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. That's all I have.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\\nCraig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. Adam, so just in some of the more cyclical markets, be it industrial or automotive, you did point out that things slowed or weakened a little bit. Anything there in terms of just customers reacting to kind of slower growth or inventory, anything on autos and industrial you can point out?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I think autos and industrial, I wouldn't group them, Craig, necessarily into just one category. I think we came into the year with a certain outlook on industrial and we're still standing behind that outlook. We still see that market as a kind of a mid-teens growth market for the year, and I think our team has just done a really wonderful job in that space. I think automotive, I did point out that we've seen just really a slight change to the negative in terms of the outlook from customers. I mean, this has been broadly reported. I don't think we're going to say anything different than what has been broadly talked about, but this is just a general reflection of a little bit of reduction in demand outlook as we head into second half and as we head, in particular, into the fourth quarter. When we look at our performance in automotive, I would say that, on a regional basis, we've been a bit stronger in North America and Asia, maybe a little bit weaker in Europe. I don't think that that is much different than also a lot of the broad reporting about the overall trends in the market. But what is just really important from our perspective, you can have always volumes going up and volumes going down and demand for volumes going up and down for a wide variety of reasons. And again, I think you all know many of those reasons. But what is critical for us is there is not a change in that adoption and the pace of adoption of electronics into cars and into industrial equipment. We continue to see just an incredible array of opportunities to really expand our position \\u2013 irregardless of the overall trends, to expand our position long term by working with our customers on a very broad basis to enable new technologies; and, in the industrial market that's really with interconnect and sensors. In the automotive market, it's interconnect and sensors and antennas. And I think all of those trends that we in our company and others in the industry have benefited for such a long time; it's not that those trends are changing whatsoever. Now, I'm not going to be the one to try to give a prognosis about what volumes are going to be beyond here in the fourth quarter. There's lots of people who are much more expert than I am to do that. But what we clearly continue to see is the long-term trend of the adoption of electronics, the enhanced electronic functionality, new applications, new systems. That trend is certainly not changing or slowing down by any token.\\nCraig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Appreciate all the color there. And then, as my follow-up for mobile devices, I know there's a lot of attention placed on one particular customer, but just given the strength that you're seeing as I look at the mobile device market, and particularly China smartphones, that the high-end capabilities you're seeing today in those phones, can you give any context in terms of the significance of that in terms of the high-end of the market kind of broadening out? And is that something that might be helping you?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. It's a really good point, and I have talked for many, many years about this market under the context of the fact that we are choosy in this market in such as that we will participate where there is really technology being embedded in the hardware of the mobile devices. And that's been a topic for, I think, the whole decade that I have been CEO of this company, which is our mobile device is eventually just kind of empty hosts for software. And we've always said that we will participate in those mobile devices where our technology, our capabilities really have value for the customer. And that will come when there's really a premium put on the hardware. And I think what you are seeing on a broad basis around the world is that the phone manufacturers, the service providers, they all know that you cannot just sell these sort of commoditized empty hosts for software and have any differentiating capability. You've got to have features in the phones. You've got to have features in the tablets. You've got to have features in the laptops and the wearables and all those various things that are mobile devices. And those features have very complex requirements. They require an incredible degree of precision. They require an incredible capability, both in design and manufacturing. And so, when we see our team really driving the success that they have here, I think it is exactly in line with our long-term expectations that hardware will continue to have real meaning to the proposition that phone manufacturers and operators make to their customers. And so, whether that's in China or whether that's in other places around the world, I think you do see lots of attempts at differentiating through the hardware, through the functionality of the devices, and we're there to support that in every place possible. And so, I think that underlying trend of hardware, there's no doubt about it, still a very positive trend for the company. Look, all that being said, and I said it in my prepared remarks and I will say it always till I'm blue in the face, it's a volatile market. And it's one where you've got to be extraordinarily agile and reactive to the demand requirements of your customer. And if you can do that consistently, be reactive, be supportive when they need you, and if you can do that with enabling capabilities and technologies, then you have a pretty good long-term position in this space. And I think that's been our recipe, so far, and will continue to be our recipe going forward.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.\\nShawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC: Hi, morning and congrats \\u2013 or I guess, afternoon, sorry. Congratulations on the results. Two questions. First, just on the mobile networks business, continuing to see some strength there, was there any regional dynamics of stronger trends in the third quarter and now for the year relative to where you were 90 days ago? And then second, it's my topic de jure as of late, the lack of M&A activity in terms of just spend relative to your free cash flow. It lagged in 2017, you're lagging 2018 here year-to-date. Is there anything that's pressuring the activity other than just pure timing?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Shawn. I mean with respect to mobile networks, as you heard, we had a very strong quarter in mobile networks. I would say that the strength that we saw was more North America and Asia related and Europe was not so strong in wireless. So, it wasn't necessarily regionally balanced. It was balanced across Asia and North America, but not so balanced across Europe. But that is maybe not necessarily surprising given the overall trends in that space, but we were just really happy with how that came out. We hadn't expected coming into the quarter. I think coming into the year, in fact, when we started out this year, we didn't have such a favorable view of the mobile networks market. And I think our team has just done an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities that have presented themselves to us, while also doing the really hard work of making sure that we're well-positioned for the future, and in particular, for the future of whatever that next generation is 5G or otherwise. And so that's \\u2013 I think, the team has done just a really outstanding job here on really a global basis. Now, relative to M&A, I've said it many times. I mean we cannot control the timing of M&A. We continue to work very hard and we have an outstanding pipeline of M&A. But the fact that we didn't close any deals in the quarter should not be at all an indication of any change in appetite or change in strategy, change of approach, or change of opportunity. I would argue that 2017, we had a pretty good year in M&A. We bought quite a number of really good companies, understanding that as a percent of free cash flow it was maybe a little bit lower than the prior year, but in the prior year, we made the largest acquisition in the history of the company. So, I wouldn't read anything long-term into that and we continue to have a strong pipeline for M&A. And I will say that we continue to have just a very, very compelling proposition to those companies who really want to join and be a part of something great, to be a part of an organization that is extraordinarily hospitable to them as entrepreneurs, to be a part of a company that has just extraordinarily \\u2013 extraordinary breadth and reach from a customer and geographical and technology perspective. It's a very, very compelling proposition for companies when they're deciding to whom do they want to sell and where do they want their company to end up. We're not going to win every deal that we've said all along. We're going to remain very disciplined on price regardless of environment and we've said that when interest rates were low. We'll say that as interest rates go up. We've said that when stock valuations were high, when stock valuations were low. We've been very consistent about that that we take a long-term approach to acquisitions in a way where we say we're going to get to know them very, very well. We're going to buy companies on the basis of great people, great product and great position. We're going to be very patient through those processes. And when we buy them, they're going to be ours for life. And that's a very, very important principle. And I think, it's been a consistently successful principle in our acquisition program.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.\\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First question is on tariffs and Adam you spoke about tariffs last quarter and some of the steps Amphenol was taking to avoid or mitigate those issues. So I was wondering if you can provide an update on that topic both to what extent Amphenol has seen any direct impact on its own financial from tariffs and whether you think tariffs are having an impact at all on customer order patterns or demand?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, no question, Mark, appreciate that. Tariffs continue to be a thing. Unfortunately, it is what it is. I would just say that what I discussed last quarter in terms of our approach and our methodology to dealing with tariffs has not changed. And let me just remind everybody about that. I mean, first and foremost, tariffs are just a thing that happened. It's not something over which we have control. While we try to lend our voice very passionately to the debate about whether or not there should be tariffs, they are what they are. And so the question then is, how do you react to those tariffs? And what we have done in our company not surprisingly given our organization and how we choose to operate this company is, we've not taken a one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with the tariffs. We have really pushed down that decision-making to those \\u2013 to the general managers around the world who are implicated, who have to deal with those tariffs. And then those who operate at that level are the best equipped to know the logistics, the manufacturing processes, the supply chain. How those products are made? Where they're shipped to? Who are the customers? And ultimately, who are the competitors? And thereby make wise and real-time decisions about the measures that one can take to mitigate. And there are really countless measures that one can take in this event, whether that is changing the location of manufacturing, changing where value is created, changing how things are flowing into what countries, or of course, adjusting price, which we do with a heavy heart to our customers, but which you must do sometimes. And I think that the combination of those very operation part-number-by-part-number specific initiatives has ultimately resulted in the third quarter when we had quite a lot of tariffs that we had to deal with in the company really not having any meaningful impact from those tariffs. And I think, when you see ultimately the operating margins of the company 20.9%, I mean, that is also a reflection of the fact that these tariffs did not have any meaningful damage to our financial position. Now there's new tariffs every day. There's more tariffs to deal with here in the fourth quarter and I'm sure there will be more next year. And one day hopefully this whole thing will get resolved. But right now, we're managing it because it is what it is. And so, as we move forward, if there are new tariffs, if there are new levels of tariffs, I'm confident that our team is going to work extremely hard in that same methodology, ultimately to make sure that Amphenol as a corporation is not harmed by what I consider relatively misguided policies.\\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And a follow-up question on the IT datacom market which has been reporting stronger results than the company had anticipated at the start of the year. Can you help deconstruct that a bit more between the piece for hyperscale and the piece tied to more traditional OEMs? And I'm curious, if hyperscale is now a big enough portion that you could help us better understand what percentage of IT datacom business is tied to hyperscale at this point.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I don't have a number for you in terms of what percentage it is. But it has continued to grow at a faster pace than the rest, but I would tell you still it's smaller by some significance to our sales to equipment manufacturers. I think we've seen very broad-based growth in the IT datacom market in particular here in the third quarter. We saw really growth across all the different types of products. So whether that's storage, server, networking. I mean, those were all very strong double-digit growth in the quarter. And I wouldn't say that there was really a concentration of that into one or another type of customer, one or another region. It was very, very broad-based. And why is that? I mean, we certainly see, as I alluded to in my prepared remarks that, the degree of technology advantage that we have developed over a number of years and that included both acquisitions that we made, our own organic product development. The breadth of product offering that we have and the depth of that offering, all the products across the price-performance curve allows us and enables us to really be a strong, and really leading partner with our customers regardless of whether they are making a carrier class router on one side, or a blade server, a rack server on the other side and everything in between. And so, it's the strength of that product technology, together with the breadth of what we're able to offer those customers that has ultimately allowed us to have that more balanced and broad-based strength in the IT datacom market. I think, we feel very good about that position because it comes really at a time when the demands put on IT hardware on a global basis continue to accelerate. Just you can't pick up a paper lately without seeing some new innovation, some new development that is generating amounts of data that you can't even imagine. I think, I saw a story this week about this sort of deep space telescope which apparently is going to generate in a year as much data as the whole Internet today occupies. And you think about this sort of exponential growth of data that is being created and things like that, things like autonomous driving, things like video on the Internet, and high-definition video. And I think the matching of our unique and proprietary technologies together with that accelerated data traffic is ultimately the story that results in these results.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open.\\nMatthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. Adam, you've done a good job by answering questions here and giving good color. One follow-up, just regarding your comments on the telecom and mobile network area, you talked about strength in really the non-5G areas and there's a lot of talk about ramping in the back half of next year into 2020 in terms of ramps. How are you seeing that play out in terms of how you're positioned specifically with technology and customers?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Matt. Look, I don't \\u2013 I can't give you a timing of ramp of 5G, but what I can tell you is that our position is very strong. I mean, our team has been working for a number of years to make sure that our products are designed in on next-generation systems in the broadest sense possible. And if you think back about what is 5G from an equipment and a performance perspective. 5G is all about speed and latency. And to get really the levels of speed and the reductions in latency that are being really targeted from a 5G and to do that all at frequency sets that are much higher than current networks are operating which thereby requires much more density, I mean that's a lot of technology that gets embedded into these products. And the interconnect products that are used in those systems and are being designed into those systems just in certain cases have real step function performance requirements. And so I give a lot of credit to our organization, our engineers around the world who've worked with customers to make sure that our products are really front and center as they go through those design considerations. And look while you don't have a \\\"5G\\\" in the IT datacom space that we were just talking about with Mark's question, it's a very similar dynamic that you have to have really that leading product and that leading suite of products such that customers can rely upon your products to help their systems perform at these extremely high levels that everybody is hoping to achieve with 5G. When the timing is going to be and I can tell you we're involved in a lot of build-outs and systems and products where there may be what's called 5G ready, does that mean they are performing in 5G networks, probably not. But we already see customers producing equipment that is forwards compatible for 5G and things like that. So as usual in these generational changes in mobile networks there's a long lead up. There's a lot of test and validation, design work. And then the building out of that system, I think, starts to go slowly and eventually you'll have \\u2013 then have some meaning to the overall spending environment. But when that's going to be is a little bit hard for us to predict.\\nMatthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Fair enough, okay. Thanks a lot.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks so much, Matt.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. I have two questions as well, guys. I guess, first one, Adam, nice to see the upside you guys have on mobile devices. I think you said it was up 70% plus sequentially in September. When you think about what drove the upside versus what you guys thought it would be 90 days ago, do you think it's more driven by the fact that others that were involved in the same components couldn't execute the way they were supposed to, which I think has happened in the past? Or was it that end demand was just better in the products you're involved in?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think in this case, the demand was better and our ability to execute on the demand was a bit better than we had anticipated. If you just think about the mechanics and logistics of in a 90-day period having an increase in sales of 70% in a market, which is not so small on an absolute basis. I mean, there's a lot of hard work involved. And I just cannot credit enough our organization, who really made that happen. And when we say make it happen in Amphenol that has a real meaning to the people inside the Amphenol organization. And they really made it happen here. I mean, whether that is getting the production lines in place, getting the right people in place, getting the factories set-up, I mean, all the things that are required. And this is a team, where this is not their first rodeo, either, as you know, very well, Amit. I mean, this \\u2013 we're used to having these significant increases, but it doesn't make them any easier. It just makes you maybe a little bit more confident, in hindsight, that you can do it, again, when it comes around. But again, the simple answer to your question, I think, this was probably less us having to bail people out like we've done in the past and more the volumes being a little bit better and our ability to execute on those volumes being a little bit better on a broad basis.\\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And if I could follow-up, you guys obviously are seeing broad-based trends in September; sounds like it's going to continue in December. I heard your comments around tariffs. I'm just wondering, right, tariffs are supposed to go to 25% on January 1 for a lot of products. Is your response and tone (48:45) going to be any different at 10% tariff or 25% tariff? And then, importantly, why do you think customers are not double ordering at this point? If I know cost of connectors goes up by 25%, I might be better off buying more today versus waiting for January 1, and do you think that creates a risk for a bit of a vacuum in the first half of 2019?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, there's a lot in that, but let's just be a little specific about what tariffs and when. As you know, there've been three lists of tariffs. There was what was called List 1, List 2, and then List 3. And if you look at the products that are in those \\u2013 in List 1, there was a product line called connectors. So \\u2013 and that was already at 25%. So List 1 and 2 were at 25%. It was List 3 that has this sort of step one at 10%, and then the second step is 25%. Are customers kind of hoarding or overbuying, in that instance? We haven't seen that, necessarily. Could there be some on the margins? I suppose there could be some, but that's also constrained by just the ability to support those demands. And it's not that you have infinite capacity to support that pull in of demand. Obviously, we'll do whatever we can with our customers. And also bear in mind that the tariffs are due when the product moves into the U.S., which is not always necessarily when you sell it to the customer. And so, that dynamic that you described is just not as clear. And we haven't seen any real clear indications of that pulling forward. I think the bigger question around tariffs, and that's one that I'm really not well equipped to answer, is what ultimately is the effect of these tariffs? Where does it resolve? Does that ultimately have any macro economical effects? Does it have other effects? Those are all things that are probably above my pay grade to think about, or at least to make a forecast about. But I think how we deal with the 10%, how we deal with the 25% of that List 3, it's going to be the same way we've dealt with the tariffs that have come so far. And we've had significant products that have been susceptible to those tariffs. Again, not forgetting about the fact that, by and large, the vast majority of what we make we make and sell in the same region. And that's part of the strategy that we've always taken of being localized to our customers, and so we're not talking about an enormous proportion of our business here; far from that. But there is some that we have to deal with and I think we've dealt with it well so far, and our team will continue to fight like heck to do so regardless of what tariff levels come.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\\nDeepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Two quick questions from me. One is automotive risk. It looks like the organic growth came in a point or two below your expectations. Just curious how much of that was market versus content coming in softer versus expectations? And what's your comfort with continuing your strong high single-digit content growth performance, if the weakness continues well into next year?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I mean, one to two points organic, I guess, it's kind of hard for me to say is that market or content. But as I said earlier, we don't see any signs of content slowing down. I mean, far from it. We continue to see new electronic systems being adopted into cars. So I guess, without knowing exactly what the drivers of the one or two points of organic change, I would say that it's probably the market. And I think I said earlier that we continued to see \\u2013 have a very favorable view, long-term, towards the continued expansion of electronic content in cars around the world. And what the market will be, what the total value \\u2013 or total units of cars is going to be, that's much harder for us to predict. But I think we still feel comfortable that content is going to continue to grow.\\nDeepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. My follow-up is on semiconductor supply chain. Are you seeing any impacts from this well-broadcasted passive shortages, either directly or indirectly? And generally, has that headwind abated? Has that accelerated? I mean, just curious. I mean, it's something that seems to have hit a lot of companies this quarter? Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thank you. No, I think we've talked about that for a couple of quarters and it's a well reported \\u2013 as you correctly point out, it's a very well-reported discussion about, in particular, passives and, I guess, some semiconductors. We have not seen any meaningful impact on the demand of our customers due to these shortages that are so widely reported. I think we're still performing very strongly. On an absolute basis, our growth has probably accelerated over the course of the year, and I think that that's a sign that it hasn't been any real meaningful impact. Have our people spent a little bit more time because there are some of these passives and other assorted components that we once in a while buy for some of our more advanced products? Sure, our sourcing team around the world is working maybe a little bit of overtime to make sure that we don't have any impact on our supply to customers. But the sort of ancillary question of, are customers buying less from us, in general, because they can't get the matching component, while there may be an odd anecdote about that, I can't say that that's had any meaningful impact to the performance.\\nDeepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. If I can sneak just one more in, sorry. Your performance no way indicates that end markets have lost momentum broadly. But my question is what is the sentiment at your customer base that are buying your products? Has that moderated versus 90 days ago? I mean, obviously that's a big deviation from the weak market sentiment we're seeing. I mean just curious what your thoughts are there? And I'll pass it on. Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you. Look I don't think I would say anything different about the sentiment than is reflected in our guidance here for the fourth quarter, which I think continues to be a very strong guidance. I think our customers continue to be very positive, at least, the ones that I have interfaced with and I visit lots of customers on a very frequent basis. I think our customers are continuing to look for us to do the same thing that we've done in many cases, which is to deliver to them enabling technologies that helps them to get their systems to operate at higher levels. We've talked about that with IT, with mobile networks, but the same is true in military where we've done a fantastic job to both produce and design advanced technology products, but also to satisfy a level of demand that probably that industry hasn't seen for quite some time. We talked about that in automotive as well where customers while there's been some slight moderation in the overall demand that demand for new technologies has really not changed, so. And I could go through the markets, all of them, and all reflect on the fact that I think our customers are very positive about the future. Our customers are very thirsty for next-generation technologies. If there are short-term swings in demand that is what it is I think for some of them.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open.\\nJim Suva - Citi: Thanks very much. Adam and Craig, any comments on what you see for inventory levels, whether it be distribution, your customers across the supply chain, because we got to think that giving the tariffs as well as uncertainty and very strong or longer than normal lead-times, one has to wonder about excess inventory or double bookings and will that show itself in a positive manner now and catch up to us? Or simply are your lead-times smaller than say maybe semiconductor companies that have a longer lead-time? Thank you.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks very much Jim. I mean, as I've said before, we don't have perfect visibility into the warehouses of our customers. We do see the inventory levels of a good degree of our distribution channel and I think their inventories seem healthy, nothing really notable in our distributors. Look, with all the things that you very astutely pointed out, things like tariffs and the various lead-times and double bookings and all of that, I think a lot of those things are much more related to these passives and semiconductors that Deepa alluded to. Remember that our industry is a different industry and the way we run our company is, once again, a little bit different. It's not a capital-intensive industry and certainly the way that we run Amphenol is not in a capital-intensive fashion. Our ability to react and to adjust to changes in demand, be those on the upside which is a bit more fun, but also on the downside, is really a reflection of that agility that we have from manufacturing perspective. And owing to that agility, we're able to keep our lead-times relatively stable. There are some anecdotes that once in a while where lead-times will go out and I think we've maybe seen a little bit of lead-time stretch in the military market with the extraordinary increase in demand there. But by and large, the way that we operate and the way that the interconnect industry operates is very different from the semiconductor and the passives industry. And thus, I think you see a healthier supply chain behavior with respect to those things that you mentioned, like double booking and other items (59:11).\\nJim Suva - Citi: Thanks so much for the details.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks, Jim.\\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question in queue comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is now open.\\nTristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering how lean are your operations at this point in the cycle in terms of capacity and utilization rates. And if you have anything you would like to highlight in terms of CapEx spending going forward?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I would just say that we always operate in a very efficient fashion. I think I just \\u2013 when we just talked with Jim about inventory levels, I mentioned that from a capital spending it's not a capital-intensive business. The way that we operate our factories is a fast and flexible fashion. So from that perspective, we're always operating lean. And that's part and parcel to the Amphenol culture. It's not that we try to get ahead of things and build huge capacities and then wait for the orders to come and nor do we when times are good, burst at the seams and can't support our customers. So we try always to scale our operational infrastructure to the demands of the customers regardless of what cycle we're in. And I think when you look over a long time period at the performance of the company, especially during volatile economic times, you'll see that that reflects exactly that principle ultimately in the numbers.\\nCraig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: And the only thing, I guess, I would add on that is as you see this year we have had a little bit higher end of our range from a capital spending perspective. I mean, we have had pretty high levels of growth organically over the first three quarters and certainly guidance for the year here. And in those years while we do have a more significant growth, we certainly do spend a little bit more on capital. But again, it's typically within that kind of 2% to 4% and this year we'll be a little bit higher up into that range. But again, that's just driving those high level of growth that we have right now.\\nTristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then Adam based on your comments about China and tariffs, I guess, you're still likely to do M&A there in China, I think, with the current situation?\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think I would answer it even more broadly, which is, we don't do M&A. We don't hunt for potential new family members in Amphenol in a way that is trying to chase the market, a hot market or run away from the market that has maybe lost favor in the electronics industry. We take a very, very long-term view towards acquisitions. Our criteria for acquisitions remains very consistent. I alluded to it earlier. We look for great people. We look for great products or in other words technology and we look for fantastic market position. And sometimes we'll make acquisitions when it's perceived to be the right time and sometimes we'll make acquisitions when it's not perceived to be the right time. And that's all part and parcel of a strategy that says we're buying these companies for the long-term, which is really for a permanent basis. We believe in Amphenol that when we make these acquisitions, we're getting married for life to those companies and to those organizations. And so whether you buy that in one quarter when that's the right place to be or in another quarter where it's not as much of the right place to be that for us is less important. So if the right company comes along, fabulous entrepreneurs, great products, great market position and that happens to be in China or that happens to be in a market space that is not necessarily the hottest space of the moment, we're not going to shy away from that. And along with that I will tell you, regardless, we're always going to be reasonable in terms of our valuation and disciplined in terms of the process of the acquisition. And I think that approach, which is really an approach that is agnostic to short-term variations in market trends and environments is one that has served us very well over the long term. Now, if there are governmental impediments that are put in place, very significant governmental impediments that are put in place, obviously we're not blind to that. And we would be very sensitive to that because any company that we buy, we want to make sure that there are not structural impediments to success. But I don't think we see that in any geography today of any significance.\\nOperator: Thank you. And speakers we show no further questions in queue at this time.\\nR. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, that's very nice. And again, thank you all very much and we truly appreciate your time today and your interest in the company. And I wish you all a very enjoyable fall season and that we will look forward to seeing you just at the beginning of 2019. Thank you all very much.\\nCraig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day. As a reminder as well, today's call was recorded.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\\nSami Badri: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first quarter fiscal year '24 quarterly conference call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's new Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Having followed Cisco on the sell-side for 10 years, I couldn't be more excited to join the company and look forward to engaging with you all in my new role. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As a reminder, we have simplified how we report product and service revenue and customer markets. Starting this quarter, we are reporting revenue in the following five categories: networking, security, collaboration, observability, and services. And we are reporting customer markets in the following three categories: enterprise, public sector, and service provider and cloud. Also, as is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on forms 10-K which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Sami, and welcome to Cisco. I hope everyone is doing well, and thanks for joining us today. We delivered a solid start to fiscal 2024, with the strongest first quarter results in Cisco's history in terms of revenue and profitability. Our Q1 revenue was at the upper end of our guided range. EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by strength in gross margins and expense control, resulting in strong operating leverage. Our disciplined expense management and the tailwinds from our business model transformation resulted in our highest non-GAAP gross margin in over 17 years and record non-GAAP operating margin. We also returned $2.8 billion in Q1 via cash dividends and share repurchases, delivering on our capital return commitments to our shareholders. As we continue to transform our business towards more software and recurring revenue streams, fueled by accelerated innovation, we remain committed to driving operating leverage and shareholder returns. Now turning to the demand environment, after three quarters of exceptionally strong product delivery, our customers are now focused on installing and implementing these unprecedented levels of products. The bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Our order lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. As deliveries rose, the channel inventory we track at our distributors also steadily declined during this time. Simply put, customers are now taking time to onboard and deploy these heightened product deliveries. While the macro challenges we have discussed still exist, we believe this implementation phase is the primary reason for the slowdown in new orders. We saw it mostly with our larger enterprise, service provider, and cloud customers, and it was most pronounced in October. Based on our analysis, we believe this phase is temporary and estimate there is an additional one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders in customers' hands, still waiting to be deployed. This has near-term consequences for revenue and our outlook for the next couple of quarters, which Scott will discuss shortly. However, it does not change our longer-term confidence. We expect product order growth rates to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. We also remain very confident in the foundational strength of our business and future growth opportunities given the criticality of our technologies. Overall, our win rates are stable, cancellation and return rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, and we have gained market share, all of which are testaments to the strength of our portfolio and how it aligns to our customers' most pressing needs. As we look to enhance our capabilities in higher growth areas, in the first quarter of fiscal '24, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk. The combination of Cisco and Splunk will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency with our complementary capabilities in AI, security, and observability. The combination of Cisco and Splunk also directly supports our strategic objectives around driving higher levels of growth, software capabilities, and ARR. Together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership and outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. Now, let me comment on our quarterly performance. As I previously mentioned, we delivered strong revenues in Q1, which was broad-based across our product portfolio and driven by our customers' investments in generative AI, cloud, security and full stack observability. As expected, we continued to gain market share with the release of the calendar Q2 results, recording another quarter of year-over-year gains in three of our largest networking markets: campus switching, wireless LAN and SP routing. In webscale, we see continued momentum in AI, with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale ethernet AI fabric. We also already have line of sight to over $1 billion in orders for AI infrastructure from major cloud providers in fiscal year '25. To help advance AI, we are working with key GPU and storage partners to create solutions including ethernet technologies, GPU-enabled infrastructure, and joint tested and validated reference architectures with a commitment to open networking for AI. Collectively, we believe there is a great opportunity for a broad set of innovations and compute GPU networking software and services to support core and edge AI infrastructure. According to the 650 Group, the AI switching market is forecasted to exceed $10 billion in 2027. Our scalable fabric for AI, coupled with a proven power saving capabilities of Cisco Silicon One put us in a strong position to build-out the infrastructure needed for AI clusters and we are laser-focused on winning in this space. Moving to Security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap and strengthen our unified security platform. Since our Cisco XDR solution became available this summer, we have added recovery to the response process giving security teams the ability to snapshot and restore their business critical data at the first sign of a ransomware attack. With our three new offers around XDR, Cisco Secure Access and Multicloud Defense, we already have over $500 million in the pipeline across over 1,000 customers. We also launched our new Cisco security firewall solution this quarter. We are actively engaged in competitive sales with all these products and expect to see meaningful positive results in the coming quarters. In our Collaboration portfolio, we recently introduced a range of truly game changing AI capabilities, spanning the entire Webex suite as well as new devices for reimagined workspaces at our WebexOne event. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me briefly summarize three key takeaways. First, as we consider where we're at today, the primary issue with demand is that customers are taking time to onboard and deploy heightened product deliveries. While we were not immune to the macro, we believe this is temporary as our customers and partners continue to tell us that our portfolio is stronger than ever and we have continued to see share gains in key markets. Second, we remain confident in our future, with the incremental multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity, the increasing criticality of security and observability, and what we believe Cisco and Splunk can do together for our customers is truly exciting. Lastly, you can always count on us to take a disciplined approach, regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation, and expense management. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\\nScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. We delivered solid results in Q1, driven by the prior strategic actions we took to mitigate the supply chain constraints. For the quarter, we reported strong revenue growth and a record non-GAAP operating margin. Total revenue was $14.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year, at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.5 billion, up 28%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.11, up 29%, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 9%; and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, drove the increase with 10% growth. Within networking, the growth was driven by switching, where campus and datacenter were both up double-digits on the strength of our Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000 offerings. This was partially offset by a decline in wireless. Security was up 4%, driven by our Zero Trust and threat intelligence, detection and response offerings. Collaboration was up 3% driven by growth in Calling and Contact Center, partially offset by a decline in Meetings. Observability was up 21%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress in our transformation to more recurring revenue based offerings. We saw solid performance in our ARR of $24.5 billion, which increased 5% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.4 billion, a 13% increase with software subscription revenue also up 13%. 85% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 10% to $6.5 billion, which represents 44% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 1 percentage point over last year. RPO was $34.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product RPO increased 14% and service RPO increased 11%. In total, short-term RPO was up 8% to $17.6 billion. Looking at our product orders by geographic segment, year-over-year, overall product orders declined 20% with the Americas down 19%, EMEA down 13% and APJC down 38%. In our customer markets, Service Provider & Cloud was down 38%, Enterprise was down 26%, and Public Sector was up slightly at 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.1%, up 410 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.5%, up 550 basis points. The increase was driven primarily by productivity improvements, with lower freight, logistics, and component costs. Favorable mix and positive pricing also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Services non-GAAP gross margin was 69%, up slightly. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 36.6%, up 480 basis points and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. This improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing disciplined cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.5 billion. We had operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.4 billion, down 40% primarily due to the $2.8 billion tax payment related to prior quarters, which was associated with the IRS tax relief due to the California floods. This quarter we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases, and growing our dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk, which we expect to close by the end of the third quarter of calendar year 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including approval by Splunk shareholders. In Q1, we also closed several acquisitions, all of which are highly complementary to our internal R&D in line with our strategy to strengthen our position in cloud, security, observability and AI with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter highlighted by topline growth and increased operating leverage that resulted in stronger than anticipated earnings per share. We continue to make progress in our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We remain focused on disciplined expense management without losing sight of the strategic investments necessary to innovate and capitalize on growth opportunities. Turning to our financial guidance, as Chuck outlined, the bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Most of the supply chain constraints are now behind us and both shipment lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. Q1 product orders declined 20% as our largest customers are implementing elevated levels of product shipments from prior quarters as we delivered orders from our historically high backlog levels. As Chuck mentioned, we believe there are one quarter to two quarters worth of shipped orders awaiting implementation by our customers. Our revenue guidance assumes, one quarter to two quarters of lower revenue and then a return to more typical sequential growth rates. Consequently, for Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82 to $0.84. For fiscal year 2024, our guidance is updated as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.8 billion to $55 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.87 to $3.93. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution this quarter. We remain confident in the strength of the business and our ability to capitalize on the key growth opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it back to Sami, so we can move into the Q&A.\\nSami Badri: Thanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue-up for questions.\\nOperator: Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\\nSami Badri: Tal, you there?\\nTal Liani: Yes. Sorry. I was on mute. Now you can hear me. What is your assumption on the growth seasonality after the next quarter? Are we back in your assumptions to normal seasonality? Or do you expect kind of different seasonality than previous years?\\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Tal, it's a great question. As I said in -- well, we talked about one quarter to two quarters of basically inventory, but shipped product that's at our customers, it's not yet been installed. I expect the impact to be greatest in Q2 and in Q3. But when you look at the order growth, we do see a return to order growth in the second-half of the year, both sequentially and year-on year as we get there.\\nTal Liani: So in terms of revenue recognition, you expect 3Q to -- the 2Q to 3Q sequentials, that's -- that was my question. Do you expect 3Q to be weaker than previous seasonality? Or do you expect it to be the same as previous seasonality? Or even sequentially?\\nChuck Robbins: No, from a revenue standpoint, we don't guide bookings, Tal, but from a revenue standpoint, I do see sequential increase, Q2 to Q3.\\nTal Liani: Okay. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Tal.\\nChuck Robbins: Thank you, Tal.\\nSami Badri: Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead.\\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just a question on, if you see the investment categories kind of changing maybe free, the orders that you've seen, and then when do you see them come back in a couple of quarters. I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of have much of the orders we've seen over the last year been catch-up investments like campus and data center? And then areas of investment will change as we come back or is this really just inventory digestion and the investment categories and kind of investment prioritization will stay the same with customers? Thanks.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Meta, thanks for the question. I think your latter comment is probably the closest to the truth. We don't anticipate a big difference. Although, I think with the improvements that we've seen in our portfolio and security, we should see security accelerate. Obviously, we'll continue to update you on the AI opportunity that's out there. We think that's going to continue to be a driver over the next couple of years. But in general, I think it will look more normal once we get through this.\\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: Thank you, Meta. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Chuck, one of the things I think folks will struggle to understand is the conviction you have that this is an implementation pause and not a macro demand-centric weakness. So I'd love to just understand whatever you can talk about it and why you're so convinced this is a one-quarter to two-quarter implementation rather than enterprise demand is just getting weaker. Anything on that front would be helpful? And then, I just want to clarify the spot. You folks had $1 billion in AI orders that's two times the number you gave last time is that correct? Thank you.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Amit, thank you. So if you'll be patient with me, I'll give you a few data points and some context around why we think this -- this is a -- an inventory issue that's sitting with our customers. First of all, our customers and our sales organizations have been very clear with us over the last 90-days that this is the issue, particularly our large enterprise and our large -- and our service providers. We talked about that with the service providers prior, but it shifted into the enterprise space in a big way. The other thing is, we had our Partner Summit last week and some of our largest partners unsolicited began their conversations with me by talking about this very issue, which candidly I knew the customers had talked about it and our sales teams had talked about it. I was actually surprised to hear. It's so consistently at that Partner Summit. So, that's sort of the subjective view and then we've done some analysis and there's three things I'd point out. The first is, in certain parts of our portfolio, we actually can -- we can see the timeframe from shipment of a product until the product begins to connect to the cloud, back to the cloud like Meraki/And what we've seen is a one-quarter to two-quarter delay versus what historically you would see when these products get shipped, how long it takes for them to be activated and connect to the Meraki cloud. So that's the first piece. The second is, we had a very strong quarter in federal, U.S. federal, from an orders perspective. And so, we looked into why big customer like the U.S. government, Department of Defense, would not have the same issue. And the reality is, is that they have special clauses in their contracts that give them most favored nation status when we're actually making shipment decisions, and certainly with the Department of Defense, we prioritize them during the supply chain crisis. So they never had a big influx, they had a very steady flow of products across, which explains why their order numbers look fairly normal. The third point I'd say is that we noticed a serious uptick in Q1 in our Transactional Advanced Services, which is loosely translated to be implementation services, where that grew almost 20% and the forecast for Q2 is almost double-digits again. So it's clear that customers are asking us to come help them get this done. And I'll give you one final subjective data point and then I'll talk about the AI stuff. We had one big partner tell us that they will have literally hired 200 people in the last 90-days, solely focused on implementing technology for their customers. So there is just so many things that we've learned over the last 90-days. Clearly, this surprised us. But I think we feel pretty good right now. I'll make a comment about why I don't think it's macro, candidly it might have been easier for me to say it was macro. But as we've discussed prior, we have -- the traditional service provider has been tough and it remains that way. We've talked about elongated sales cycle, they remain. We've talked about, in some cases, the need for extra signatures, which is pretty normal, that's remained. But we didn't see it get materially worse in the quarter. And so all of that -- and I'm sorry for the long answer, but I wanted to be thorough, all of that is really what led us to believe this -- that this is a consumption issue with our customers. So I'm going to pause there, and then I'm going to answer your AI question. What we gave last time was orders to-date. We have taken orders for over $500 million. For infrastructure to support AI networks, AI GPUs inside the cloud players. Then -- and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. The numbers that we gave today is a forward-looking set of numbers. Let's say, in fiscal year \\u201825, which is when we said, we believe that the broad ethernet build-out would occur underneath GPUs. We have already seen -- we have line of sight to $1 billion plus of orders that our teams feel pretty good that we're going to get and/or we've been designed in already. So that's just sort of a forward-looking set of orders that we've identified for fiscal \\u201825, okay. I will also just cover real quickly, we are now -- we now have our ethernet fabric deployed underneath GPUs in three of the four Hyperscalers, major Hyperscalers in the United States. We also are working very closely with AMD, Intel and NVIDIA, to create solutions including ethernet technology's GPU-enabled infrastructure joint -- jointly tested and validated reference architectures. And I will say even this week, yesterday, Jensen from NVIDIA and four of his -- four, five of his executives came over to see us and we spent 90 minutes together with my executive team. And we believe we have a great opportunity to actually build some integrated solutions between our technology and their technology to actually take to the enterprise. So we're beginning to see the use cases in the enterprise evolve. And we think that partnership with NVIDIA, in that case, with our underlying technology and our strength of go to market, we think will be a winning combination. So we're working on that as well. So there's a lot going on in the AI space.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Amit. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Thank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead.\\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you'd be willing to unpack the networking segment a little bit in terms of the trends. And really what I'm trying to get at is, understand sort of what's doing better, what's doing worse, and in that I suspect it's datacenter bounced us pretty good whereas maybe campus is a bit weaker and declining. And that hopefully during this transition to the new segmentation, if you could give us a little bit more color within networking? Thank you.\\nChuck Robbins: Hey, Simon, thanks for that. I would say the bigger variance that we're seeing, I mean, right now, obviously the demand signal is little bit tough because of the amount of inventory that's out in the field and that we have normalized lead times at this point. We knew that would happen sometime in the first half. That's now happened. Our lead times are back to where they were pre-pandemic. And our backlog has shipped. The supply chain team has done a terrific job getting product out the door. That's what's kind of moved the bottleneck from our level down to our customers' level. But when you start to unpack within networking, we're not seeing at this point, a huge difference between, for example, datacenter or campus networking. But what we are seeing is a little more field-based inventory on wireless access points. That's been slightly slower than what we've seen. It just because of the amount of product that's been shipped out than what we've seen in the rest of the networking.\\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Simon.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thanks, Simon.\\nSami Badri: All right. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir.\\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about your share repurchase cadence. Stock obviously could get hit here. We have been talking about $5 billion in buybacks or so for the year. I know some of that stops that dilution. If you guys are confident in the second half pickup, is there any potential that you would be more aggressive in the upcoming quarter? And how are you thinking about share repo this year, given current dynamics with the Splunk deal coming? Thanks.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes, Ben, as we said on the Splunk transaction, it's going to be outside of the transactional costs. It's going to be cash flow positive from the first year forward. So the Splunk transaction is not, in any way, having an effect on our capital return, either through the dividend or through the -- through share buybacks. We expect to continue that higher level and consistent higher level of share buybacks, and to continue to show increases in our dividend. We also will obviously look at the opportunity -- at the chance to be opportunistic on the share buyback. I'm not going to commit to that at this moment, but that is something that we will obviously take a look at.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Ben.\\nBen Reitzes: Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, if I can just clarify one thing first. I think, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you did say, you saw the more pronounced impact on the orders in the month of October. I think that's what I heard you say. I mean, just curious, are you implying that you did see an improvement in orders in the sort of first couple of weeks of November itself and that's maybe part of your confidence in that? It's a bit more temporary than a longer pause from the customers? And then you did mention large partners really being the ones that are facing this sort of inventory installation problem. What gives you sort of color that SMB, the smaller customers sort of not going to face the similar issue or are you also baking that in, in terms of your sort of next couple of quarters of headwinds that you're thinking about on the revenue side? Thank you.\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Samik. I think my point with October was that if you go back to the end of Q4, we talked about on the last call that we had a fair amount of momentum as we exited the quarter, which is one of the reasons we didn't expect to see this. And we had our normal year-end sales, moving accounts around, moving territories around, and getting sort of the sales start-up process that happens in the first say six weeks of the fiscal year, which we went through. So what we tend to look for is the middle of the quarter. And then into October is when we expect to see, the actual quarter materialize and everything kind of come together, and it just didn't. And that's what -- that was the comment about that it was primarily -- we really -- it was really clear to us in October that -- that this was going to be the situation. Relative to they\\u2019re the ones who are having the consumption issue because they have the most inventory. You asked how we -- what confidence we have if it's not SMB, if you look at orders, we look at -- we look at a sub-segmentation within enterprise now, and within service provider, etc., and SMB was fine. And in fact, the smaller the customer we had, the better their order performance for us in the quarter was. So it just follow the trend that the consumption issue was upmarket and small to mid-sized customers didn't feel it.\\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Samik. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Scott, maybe this is for you. I just want to unpack maybe one of the comments that you made. And I know you don't guide to orders. But I think in your prepared remarks, you said backlog is back at normal levels at the end of the quarter. So, we do assume that the guide for Q2 and the rest of the year doesn't include backlog conversion into revenue? And then, if that's the case, to your comment about orders accelerating in the second half, I know you don't guide specifically to orders, but you did make a comment that revenue is going be up, I think, sequentially in the third quarter year-over-year and in the fourth quarter sequentially and year-over-year. Doesn't that suggest like a pretty steep order acceleration, not just an acceleration, but significant positive order trajectory in the fourth quarter and the third quarter? I know, it's easy comps. But just some more color there would be helpful. Thanks.\\nScott Herren: Yes. Yes, David, we did say that. I do. We are expecting sequential improvement in the second half of the year in both Q3 and in Q4. And in both -- and again, we don't guide this, but in both orders and revenue as you'd expect. Backlog is normalized at this point. We knew that would happen in the first half. I think supply chain team did a great job getting those orders in the hands of our customers. We would now need them to implement them, but we've got the orders in the hands of our customers. So we do see sequential increases. And as you said, as you noted from a bookings standpoint, our order standpoint, the second half has easier compare points. Obviously, the reverse is true on revenue and the second half revenue will have very difficult compare points than last year.\\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, David. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys, thank you for taking the question. Maybe just to dovetail one follow-up to the prior question, I have just another one on margins. Just on the prior one, is the expectation for a second-half improvement in a one-quarter to two-quarter digestion, does that vary at all across the three different customer sets you outlined? And then just on the margins, 36.6% on op income margins this quarter, I think the guide implies a 400 basis point to 500 basis point dip. Is that due to just the sheer revenue decline sequentially? Or are there other cost items we should consider on either the gross margin or OI margin line? Thanks.\\nScott Herren: Yes. To your second question, it is just based on how the revenues are flowing through the second half of the year. I think gross margins, we've said will settle in somewhere in this 65% to 66% range. I think at this point, it looks like it will be closer to the higher end of that range for the second part of the year. So that's the way I see the year flowing out. Remind me, Matt, what was the first part of your question.\\nMatt Niknam: Just around the expectation for second-half improvement in orders one quarter to two quarters worth of installation, is that broad across the three customer sets? Or does it vary across service provider, enterprise and federal?\\nScott Herren: Yes, right. I think, we expect -- I certainly would expect service provider to continue to be difficult through the second-half of the year. Within service provider, we've got both telco and cable, which has one set of market dynamics going on. I think that will be -- continue to be a difficult space. On the other side, we have web scale, and we do see the web scale orders while they've got also inventory to work their way through. We do see line of sight to them beginning to increase their orders again in the second half of the year. So, SP is a bit of a mixed bag, but I think it will continue to have probably the greater impact.\\nMatt Niknam: Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Matt. Michelle, next question.\\nOperator: George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\\nGeorge Notter: Hi. Thanks a lot, guys. Just continuing on, on that last question. If I look around the space, companies have been dealing with excess inventories for really three quarters now. And I guess, I'm just curious why is this now becoming more evident at Cisco versus a few quarters ago? And then also you mentioned that the issue is spreading more to enterprises. We don't typically think about enterprises is inventorying infrastructure. So I guess, the question for you is, has something changed there or is this more distribution channel inventory? Any insight would be great. Thanks.\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, George. I think that the reason it's become relevant now is because if -- I mean, we really unloaded our backlog in the last six months. I mean -- and it was billions of dollars more than what we would normally ship to customers during that time period. So they -- I think it's just -- and we know that the cloud providers, as an example, had been buying ahead and they had been doing it for sure to your point. And all along, we have very sequenced purchasing cycles with those players. So we kind of know when they are going to start placing their next orders. I think on the enterprise, we're talking about the top 200 customers, right. These are the big customers who actually -- if they're doing a refresh of their infrastructure, they might order 400, 500 switches, as an example. Or they may be doing a branch rollout. And in some cases, to your point, it could be sitting with them or they could have a partner who's doing the staging, and the partner may be backed up with resources to try to get the staging done. So it varies, but it could be a -- either one of those or a combination of both.\\nScott Herren: And George, just to put some data to that. And you have this data, but I'll repeat it. Our revenue growth, obviously, the quarter we're announcing now, product revenue growth was 9%. But if you go back to Q4, product revenue growth was 20%. And in Q3, it was 17%. So obviously, we get revenue when we can complete a shipment and get it out the door. It gives you a sense of just how much has been pushed out and as Chuck said in the last two or three quarters.\\nGeorge Notter: Alright. Thank you.\\nSami Badri: Thank you, George. And then Michelle, we have time for one last question.\\nOperator: Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, on the AI orders, $1 billion. What's the feedback from the hyperscalers on your improving position with these customers relative to a few years ago? Is it selling in a more disaggregated fashion with Silicon One? Is it a desire for silicon diversification? And then the second question just as a follow-up on the order slowdown. Was that more concentrated in the campus with wireless LAN and wired or data center or both, just within enterprise specifically?\\nChuck Robbins: Thanks, Michael. On the AI question relative to the cloud players, I think that -- look, I think early on, we regained our footing there because we listened and we showed flexibility with our willingness to disaggregate if they wanted to do so. And we're in -- I can't even remember, but numerous use cases across the large web scale players. And I think we added over 10 new use cases last quarter alone, where we had been designed in. And I think it's -- so I think that the disaggregation and the flexibility and us listening to them and understanding what they wanted was the reason that we got back in. And now the feedback is as long as we're performing, I think they like our products, they like the power savings of Silicon One. It's a massive power -- lower -- massively lower power consumption. I think they do like silicon diversity for sure. And then as you look at the AI infrastructure that's currently primarily being supported via InfiniBand, they just want to move to more of a standard broad-based technology like Ethernet that they can actually have multiple sources. And so we think that's what's driving that now. And now it's just about performing and executing and delivering on what we tell them we're going to do. Scott, do you want to take the second?\\nScott Herren: Yes. Michael, I think I touched on this earlier in the -- as the question came up. I think the way to think about it is, first of all, if you're trying to generalize the trend more broadly across the industry, it may be a little difficult because we've cleared our backlog, I think, significantly faster than others have. But where we saw a differentiation was less between big data center infrastructure and campus networking and more between networking and wireless. We did see -- because we've shipped an enormous amount of wireless access points out. We did see that take a little bit more of an impact just because it's -- our customers are sitting on more inventory on hand of that, that they're looking to get installed.\\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, Scott.\\nChuck Robbins: Thank you.\\nSami Badri: All right. Thank you, Michael, and all right. So we'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck, for some closing remarks.\\nChuck Robbins: Yes. Thank you, Sami, and welcome again. Listen, we're proud of the team for the performance in Q1. Obviously, a very solid quarter with the exception of this demand issue that we talked about. We'll always try to be transparent with you and share with you exactly what we're seeing. We know what's going on. We're on top of it, and we do feel that it's temporary. At the same time, we're very confident in our opportunities long term. We're confident in the AI opportunity. We're very encouraged by our improving position in security, observability. And we're also very encouraged by the opportunities that will come with the Splunk acquisition. I think many of you know that on Monday night, the waiting period for review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. expired, meaning that we've effectively pass the antitrust review period in the United States. We're excited about that. At our Partner Summit last night -- or last week, the feedback on our portfolio right now was probably as good as it's been in a long time. And I also just want to reiterate our commitment to delivering value to you and our shareholders with the operating leverage, capital allocation and obviously managing our expenses in times when we see challenges like we have right now. So thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it back over to Sami.\\nSami Badri: Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 second quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 14, 2024 and at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.\\nOperator: And thank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 1 (800) 834-5839. For participants dialing from outside the U.S., please dial (203) 369-3351. This concludes today's call. You may disconnect at this time.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date_plus_7\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2015-01-13\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-12-27\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 986,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2022-04-26\",\n          \"2021-07-28\",\n          \"2016-07-07\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date_plus_1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2015-01-07\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-12-21\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 986,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2022-04-20\",\n          \"2021-07-22\",\n          \"2016-07-01\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2015-01-06\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-12-20\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 986,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2022-04-19\",\n          \"2021-07-21\",\n          \"2016-06-30\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date_minus_1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2015-01-05\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-12-19\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 986,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2022-04-18\",\n          \"2021-07-20\",\n          \"2016-06-29\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"day_of_week\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Tuesday\",\n          \"Friday\",\n          \"Wednesday\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"price\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 128.7181702027396,\n        \"min\": 0.515749990940094,\n        \"max\": 907.6799926757812,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1569,\n        \"samples\": [\n          103.8499984741211,\n          46.060001373291016,\n          144.02000427246094\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"price_minus_1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 129.57709209240718,\n        \"min\": 0.5112500190734863,\n        \"max\": 917.9500122070312,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1538,\n        \"samples\": [\n          20.1812686920166,\n          19.93000030517578,\n          39.784751892089844\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"price_plus_7\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 128.91122356311587,\n        \"min\": 0.5317500233650208,\n        \"max\": 950.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1566,\n        \"samples\": [\n          57.189998626708984,\n          32.11249923706055,\n          27.069181442260742\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"price_plus_1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 128.42918267365815,\n        \"min\": 0.515749990940094,\n        \"max\": 956.5800170898438,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1572,\n        \"samples\": [\n          18.19499969482422,\n          63.58000183105469,\n          61.7599983215332\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"return_7\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0809108538086375,\n        \"min\": -0.4127745145965187,\n        \"max\": 0.5179911407781252,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1567,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.01969603979042911,\n          0.3141763236091131,\n          0.06767941596945337\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"return_1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.06477745343158224,\n        \"min\": -0.33052148153607863,\n        \"max\": 0.2887989726572173,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1567,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.008739798651234088,\n          0.2835249192642493,\n          0.06495866020184815\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"transcript_tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
